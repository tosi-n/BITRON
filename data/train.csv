478	Background 25,000 infants are born extremely preterm every year in Europe. This group of infants carries a high risk of death and subsequent cerebral impairment for the infant, especially in the first 72 hours of life. Mortality is about 20%, and about 25% of survivors live with either cerebral palsy or low intelligence quotient. Preventative measures are keys to reducing mortality and morbidity in this population. There is evidence that the cerebral oxygenation time spent out of range (time with hypoxia or hyperoxia) is associated with poor outcome in infants. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to monitor tissue oxygenation since the mid-1980s, and quantification of oxygenation (rStO2) in a percentage from 0 to 100% has been possible for 10 years. From almost 400 preterm infants normal ranges of rStO2 has been determined to be from 55% to 85%. Still, there are no clinical trials and thus no solid evidence of the clinical utility of NIRS in preterm infants. Thus, research on the benefits and harms of cerebral monitoring using NIRS as a part of clinical management of premature infants is much needed.  Objectives The primary objective of the SafeBoosC trial is to examine if it is possible to stabilise the cerebral oxygenation of extremely preterm infants during the first 72 hours of life through the application of cerebral NIRS oximetry and implementation of an rStO2-specific clinical treatment guideline. We hypothesise that by using the specified treatment guideline to respond to cerebral monitoring readings outside the target range, we would reduce the burden of hypo- and hyperoxia and consequently reduce brain injury.  Trial design This is an investigator-initiated randomised, blinded, multinational, phase II feasibility clinical trial involving preterm infants from 12 European countries.  Inclusion criteria The inclusion criteria are: neonates born more than 12 weeks preterm (gestational age up to 27 weeks and 6 days); decision to conduct full life support; parental informed consent; and cerebral NIRS oximeter placed within 3 hours after birth.  Sample size With a 50% reduction of the area outside the normal range of oxygenation in %hours in the experimental group compared to the control group as the minimal clinically significant difference, a standard deviation of the area outside the normal range of 83.2 %hours, a type I error (alpha) of 5%, and a type II error of 0.05 (power of 95%) inclusion of 75 preterm infants in the experimental group and 75 preterm infants in the control group is required. The inclusion of twins are likely to decrease power, so it has been decided to increase sample size to 165 on a pragmatic basis of estimating intracluster correlation, control event rate, and incidence of twin births.  Intervention The premature infants will be randomised into one of two groups (experimental or control). Common is that both groups will have a cerebral oximeter monitoring device placed within three hours after birth. In the experimental group, the cerebral oxygenation reading is visible, and the infant will be treated accordingly using a defined treatment guideline. In the control group, the cerebral oxygenation reading is NOT visible, and the infant will be treated as usual.  Trial duration Monitoring by cerebral oximeter will be started as soon as possible and within 3 hours after birth and the intervention will last for 72 hours. Thereafter, each neonate will be followed up at term date (approximately three months after birth) and at 24 months after term date.  Outcome measures The primary outcome is the burden of hypo- and hyperoxia in %hours during the first 72 hours after birth. The secondary outcomes are brain activity on an amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG), blood biomarkers (brain fatty acid binding protein (BFABP), neuroketal, and S100β), serious adverse reactions (SARs), severe brain injury, and all cause mortality at term date (approximately three months after birth). The exploratory outcomes are burden of hypoxia, burden of hyperoxia, neonatal morbidities, brain injury score on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), number of therapies implemented during the intervention, physiological variables (mean blood pressure (BP), pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2), and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2)), and psychomotor impairment according to neurodevelopmental scales at 24 months after term date.	0

351	Primary Objective:  To assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of iniparib as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy.  Secondary Objectives:  To assess the antitumor effect of iniparib (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) Version 1.1 in patients with measurable disease. To characterize iniparib (and its metabolites, if possible) pharmacokinetics.  Based on data generated by Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.	0

85	In December 2019, the Municipal Health Committee of Wuhan, China, identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia of unknown cause. This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by that virus, COVID-19. Recent numbers show that 222,643 infections have been diagnosed with 9115 deaths, worldwide. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. In this scenario, the situation of a global public health emergency and evidence about the potential positive effect of chloroquine (CQ) in most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and recent data on small trials on SARS-CoV-2, the investigators intend to investigate the efficacy and the safety of CQ diphosphate in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the scenario of SARS-CoV2. Preliminary in vitro studies and uncontrolled trials with low number of patients of CQ repositioning in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging. The main hypothesis is that CQ diphosphate will reduce mortality in 50% in those with severe acute respiratory syndrome infected by the SARS-COV2. Therefore, the main objective is to assess whether the use of chloroquine diphosphate reduces mortality by 50% in the study population. The primary outcome is mortality in day 28 of follow-up. According to local contingency plan, developed by local government for COVID-19 in the State of Amazonas, the Hospital Pronto-Socorro Delphina Aziz, located in Manaus, is the reference unit for the admission of serious cases of the new virus. The unit currently has 50 ICU beds, with the possibility of expanding to 335 beds, if needed. The hospital also has trained multiprofessional human resources and adequate infrastructure. In total, 440 participants (220 per arm) will receive either high dose chloroquine 600 mg bid regime (4x150 mg tablets, every 12 hours, D1-D10) or low dose chloroquine 450mg bid regime (3x150mg tablets + 1 placebo tablet every 12 hours on D1, 3x150mg tablets + 1 placebo followed by 4 placebo tablets 12h later from D2 to D5, and 4 placebo tablets every 12 hours, D6-D10). Placebo tablets were used to standardize treatment duration and blind research team and patients. All drugs administered orally (or via nasogastric tube in case of orotracheal intubation). Both intervention and placebo drugs will be produced by Farmanguinhos. Clinical and laboratory data during hospitalization will be used to assess efficacy and safety outcomes.	0

471	The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine whether combining iniparib (BSI-201) with standard chemotherapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer patients improve clinical benefit compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy alone.  Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it was concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.

810	"In December 2019, a new identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, causes public health crisis in China and spreads worldwide. On February 11,2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus ""COVID-19"". The Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its outbreak. Meanwhile, five editions of ""Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia"" has been timely and continuously issued, which play extremely important roles in guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China.  The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS.  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. The rise of VEGF levels may be caused by hypoxia, severe inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium itself. Numerous studies have confirmed a key role of VEGF as potential therapeutic target in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due do increase vascular permeability and induce pulmonary edema.  Thus, Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF medication, may offer a unique approach to treat ALI/ARDS caused by COVID-19. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with long half-life. It has been approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics having been widely understood. Therefore, Bevacizumab is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI/ARDS as well as reduction of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients through suppression of pulmonary edema."	0

650	Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of atopic diseases (eczema, food allergy, allergic rhinitis and asthma) has been rising over the last few decades. The rate of increase precludes genetic make-up as the sole cause of the atopic epidemic and implicates environmental factors instead. Currently, allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is one of the world's most common chronic allergic diseases. It affects over 600 million people and often leads to asthma. There are huge costs associated with the condition in terms of both health care and work days lost, with British businesses estimated to lose £324 million this summer alone. For the sufferers, the symptoms severely affect their quality of life. It disturbs their sleep and impairs daytime concentration and performance at work or school. Currently there is no cure for it.  The importance of the gut microbiota in general well-being is evidenced by several experimental observations. It is difficult to achieve oral tolerance in germ-free animals [Sudo et al. 1997] while administration of lipopolysaccharide (a constituent of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria) together with food antigens increases the tolerizing effect of feeding [Kim & Ohsawa 1995]. While able to assist in tolerance induction, bacterial products may also break oral tolerance [Gaboriau-Routhiau et al. 1996]. These findings led Wold to suggest in 1998 that an altered normal intestinal colonization pattern in infancy, which fails to induce immunological tolerance, could be responsible for the increase in allergies. Recent studies suggest that the effects of the gut microbiota may not only be related to food antigens, but also to aeroallergens [Noverr et al. 2004, 2005]. Forsythe and his colleagues (2007) managed to attenuate adverse airway responses in a mouse model of allergic asthma through oral administration of probiotics.  The mechanisms by which probiotics exert their effects are unknown at present, but experiments in mice have documented improved gastrointestinal barrier function [Ewaschuk et al. 2008]. Since these experiments have also revealed a strain-dependent heterogeneity in the efficacy of probiotics [N.G. Hord 2008] it is unlikely that improved barrier function alone is responsible for the beneficial effects noted. Given the sheer numbers of microorganisms that inhabit our mucosal surfaces, it is likely that there are normally bidirectional interactions between them and the epithelial, immune, neurologic and endocrine physiological processes initiated by and between them. We hypothesize that a probiotic organism is ingested in sufficient quantities to amplify its particular trait relative to the milieu of other organisms present in relatively lower quantities, temporarily over-riding the diversity present. In that case, the transfer of information between the probiotic organism and cellular components of the gut has particular impact. In order to understand and manipulate this probiotic-mucosa cross-talk towards therapeutic advantage, there is a need to focus on the transfer of information between the microbiota and cellular components of the mucosal immune system.  Few studies have examined the effect of probiotics on allergic rhinitis and the studies that have been performed [Helin et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2004; Xiao et al. 2006] are inconclusive. In our own pilot study we tested the ability of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) to alter immunological events in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) [Ivory et al. 2008]. The study format was double-blinded and placebo-controlled with ten SAR sufferers in each group. We compared changes in immune status arising through the daily ingestion of a milk drink supplied by Yakult, with or without live LcS, over a period of 5 months. Pre-, peak- and post-grass pollen season blood samples were collected for determination of plasma grass pollen-specific IgG and IgE levels by immunoassay. At the same time, cytokine levels were determined by flow cytometric bead array technology following culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for six days in the presence or absence of specific grass pollen antigens. We found that volunteers treated with LcS showed a significant reduction in levels of antigen-induced IL-5, IL-6 and IFN- production compared to volunteers supplemented with placebo. Meanwhile, levels of pollen-specific IgG increased and IgE decreased in the probiotic group. Other changes in cytokine levels were seen but they did not attain statistical significance, most likely due to the small number of volunteers tested. Our work has established for the first time that probiotic supplementation modulates immune responses in allergic rhinitis through down-regulation of both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines and to beneficially alter the balance of pollen-specific IgG and IgE levels in allergic rhinitis subjects. It has also suggested that the impact of probiotics reaches beyond the intestine.  We would now like to conduct another study to show that the immunological changes arising through probiotic consumption have an impact on the clinical symptoms of hay fever. In addition, we propose to elucidate some of the mechanisms involved that may contribute to the health benefit. As far as we know there have not been any similar studies to date. The ability to demonstrate clinical efficacy of dietary intervention for hay fever treatment has obvious benefits for the relevant sufferers. Economic benefits would arise through the relatively inexpensive 'treatment' that would be self-administered and likely lower absenteeism from work. There is also a need for evidence-based viability for the many health claims made for probiotic consumption that could result in clear guidance to the general public.	0

284	This pilot phase I trial compares administration schedules of anti-programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not yet known what the best administration schedule is for these treatments.	0

139	Background:  Researchers are testing version of a system known as a magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scanner that uses strong magnetic fields, radio waves and the like to create images of the organs in the body. It uses lower energy levels than other MRI scanners. This may help scan people with metal devices in their body, or in invasive heart procedures using metal tools.  Objective:  To test a new MRI scanner and software changes to create better pictures.  Eligibility:  People with disease and healthy volunteers, ages 18 and older.  Design:  Participants will be screened with blood tests.  Participants may have both the new MRI and a conventional MRI or only the new one. If 2 are done, they must be within 60 days.  For both MRI versions, participants lie on a table that slides into a large tube. During scans, they will hold their breath for up to 20 seconds at a time. Heart activity will be measured by wires connected to pads on the skin. A flexible belt may be used to monitor their breathing. They will be in the scanner up to 2 hours.  Participants can agree to have a dye called gadolinium injected into their arm during the scan. This brightens the pictures.  Participants can agree to take a drug called a vasodilator. This helps detect areas of the heart with abnormal blood supply. Scans of the heart are taken before, during, and after they get the medicine. The drug may cause temporary chest pain or shortness of breath. They may get other drugs to relieve these symptoms.  Sponsoring Institution: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute	0

457	Based on data regarding the effect of colchicine on the inflammasome NLP3 and microtubule formation and associations thereof with the pathogenetic cycle of SARS-COV-2, the question arises whether colchicine, administered in a relatively low dose, could potentially have an effect the patients' clinical course by limiting the myocardial necrosis and pneumonia development in the context of COVID-19. If present, this effect would be attributed to its potential to inhibit inflammasome and (less probably) to the process of SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis in myocardial and endothelial respiratory cells.	0

603	This work will serve both the Everett Clinic and broader UnitedHealth Group patient populations as well as advance the public health emergency (PHE) response to the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially as the number of cases and deaths continues to rise in many geographies. Leveraging our presence in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with Everett Clinic, we intend to develop a model that can screen a large number of patients at varying levels of risk and manifestation of clinical symptoms while conserving personal protective equipment (PPE) and decreasing transmission risk to health care workers. This will also serve to support the enterprise and public health response. Towards this goal, we must first assess the equivalence between clinician-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 across a broad cross-section of the population.	0

367	This is a parallel group, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study designed to assess whether vandetanib (ZD6474) confers an improvement in PFS as compared to placebo in subject with locally advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma failing or unsuitable for radioiodine therapy. The trial should be of a sufficient size so that if vandetanib (ZD6474) is truly active there is a high probability that it will demonstrate an effect sufficiently promising to warrant a follow-up assessment.  Subjects will be seen weekly for the first 2 weeks, then again at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 after randomization, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Upon disease progression, all subjects (both active and placebo) will be unblinded and given the option to discontinue blinded study treatment and enter follow up and survival, or begin open label vandetanib (ZD6474) 300 mg treatment. All subjects will be followed to collect survival data until ≥50% of subjects have died. Subjects who are taking vandetanib (ZD6474) at the time of study closure and wish to remain on therapy will be allowed to continue for as long as the Investigator feels that they are obtaining clinical benefit, or until they are given another anti-cancer therapy. The safety data from all subjects will be assessed on an ongoing basis, including discontinuation and follow up. Radiologic evaluation using RECIST criteria will be performed every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks). All medical images will be centralized assessed at the site and centrally reviewed. Subjects will be evaluated until progression, and will then be followed up for survival, regardless of whether they continue randomized treatment, unless they withdraw consent. Post progression open-label vandetanib (ZD6474) will be offered at the investigators discretion. All subjects must submit a suitable archived tumor sample prior to randomization. In the event that a suitable archived sample is not available within 2 weeks prior to randomization, a fresh tumor sample must be obtained in its place prior to randomization. If a subject undergoes the fresh tumor biopsy procedure, this specimen will satisfy the first optional tumor biopsy submission should they consent to the exploratory part of the study.	0

332	Cytokines and chemokines are thought to play an important role in immunity and immunopathology during virus infections [3]. Patients with severe COVID-19 have higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) compared to individuals with mild disease or healthy controls, similar to patients with SARS or MERS . The change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients are correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Importantly, previous studies showed that viroporin E, a component of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), forms Ca2C-permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation . The mechanisms are unclear.  Colchicine, an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders (i.e., Familiar Mediterranean Fever and Bechet disease) and in gout, counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6, that are formed in response to danger signals. Recently, colchicine has been successfully used in two cases of life-threatening post-transplant capillary leak syndrome. These patients had required mechanically ventilation for weeks and hemodialysis, before receiving colchicine, which abruptly restored normal respiratory function and diuresis over 48 hrs [4].	0

530	Cov2-SARS is an emerging respiratory virus of the coronavirus family responsible for a global epidemic since November 2019. As of March 10, 2020, it had caused more than 160,000 cases of corona virus disease (COVID-19), including more than 6,500 deaths worldwide. France is one of the main epidemic outbreaks with more than 5,000 confirmed cases and the number of diagnosed patients is increasing every day.  The number of confirmed paediatric cases is relatively low, and the mortality rate in children is close to zero. This contrast suggests that children are more likely to present pauci-symptomatic or even asymptomatic forms of the disease, which are therefore undiagnosed in most cases. Given the rapid spread of this virus, and the fact that indigenous cases without an obvious chain of transmission now appear to be frequent in France, it is possible that the pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic child may play a role in the transmission of the pathogen and the dynamics of the epidemic, as documented for other respiratory pathogens such as influenza. Based on this hypothesis, the closure of children's communities has been organized in France and other highly endemic countries.	0

238	"The acute lung injury caused by SARS and 2003 were both related to the inflammatory cytokine storm in patients. The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical ""white"" lung"". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those of ordinary pneumonia. We hope that by adding pirfenidone as a treatment program in addition to standard treatment, it will be a new and severe type of coronavirus infection. Patient clinical treatment provides an effective and practical method."	0

492	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has been discovered recently in December 2019 from wuhan city in China to spread in more than 40 countries allover the world. This disease has gain the attention of all nations after it has been stated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 12, 2020. Currently no treatment has been proved to be efficient in the treatment of infected patients by COVID-19. Natural honey has been demonstrated as potent antimicrobial in many research investigations and has been considered a good alternative for antiviral drugs for the treatment of some viral infections. The investigators aim to study the efficacy of natural honey in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in this randomized , multicenter, controlled trial, comparing honey in one arm to standard care in the other arm.	0

741	Background: Highly communicable and virulent diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and “avian influenza”, the ongoing threat of other emerging infectious diseases, and the prospect of bio-terrorism have become part of the new reality for health care workers (1). Recent experience with SARS has demonstrated that front-line health care professionals who perform or assist with aerosol generating procedures are at particularly increased risk of infection.  At present, no data exists addressing the question of self-contamination during the removal of personal protective systems used in a health care setting. The latest suggested donning and removal procedures have not been validated with respect to the issue of selfcontamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions.  The failure of a personal protective system or the donning and removal procedures for a personal protective system may be associated with significant consequences in terms of the morbidity and mortality of front-line health care workers. It is imperative that the rate of self-contamination for these two personal protective systems be assessed.  The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists between the rate of self-contamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions for individuals wearing either Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or the Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR).  This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover study.  Institutional Ethics Committee approval will be obtained for this study. Fifty participants will be required for the study. Participants will be recruited from the Department of Anesthesiology attending and resident staff, other physician groups requiring PAPR training, and the Department of Respiratory Therapy. Recruitment will occur in conjunction with annual training in the use of the PAPR. Individuals will be informed of the purpose and procedure of the study and written consent will be obtained. Individuals will be excluded if they refuse to provide written consent to participate in the study.  Participants will wear operating room scrub attire as their base clothing layer.  They will be randomized to don either the PAPR or PPE. They will then repeat the process using the other personal protective system immediately after the study protocol has been completed using the first personal protective system.  PPE will consist of an N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, bouffant hair cover, fluid resistant surgical gown, and fitted sterile gloves. Although the CDC has omitted a head covering as part of their PPE, the MOHLTC directives stipulate that a head covering must be worn when performing high-risk procedures in patients that require enhanced respiratory and contact precautions. A head covering (bouffant hair cover) will therefore form part of the PPE used in this study. The CDC recommendations state that goggles can be worn for eye protection. A face shield can be used in addition to the goggles but this is optional. The MOHLTC directives state that goggles and a face shield must be worn during high-risk procedures in patients that require enhanced respiratory and contact precautions. Goggles and a face shield will therefore form part of the PPE for this study. Therefore the donning and removal instructions for the PPE that will be used for this study will differ in sequence from those published by the CDC. The donning and removal procedures that will be used for this study more closely follow the sequence recommended by the MOHLTC and are indeed an enhanced version of those directives.  PAPR will consist of a body suit and shoe covers, PAPR hood and power unit, N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, bouffant hair cover, fluid resistant surgical gown, and fitted sterile gloves. The MOHLTC has stipulated the use of donning/removal coaches for the PAPR. Neither the CDC, the MOHLTC, nor our institution have stipulated the use of donning/removal coaches for the PPE. The intent of this study is to examine the protective systems. The donning and removal procedures that form part of the protective systems may either contribute to or minimize self-contamination rates and must be assessed under the actual conditions of use. In order to best simulate the actual conditions that health care workers will be subjected to and to best evaluate donning and removal procedures and practices we have also decided not to employ a donning/removal coach for the PPE. Accordingly, during donning and removal of PPE participants will be given standardized written instructions outlining the donning and removal procedure but will not be coached.  Participants will be given standardized written instructions and coached by a respiratory therapist during donning and removal of the PAPR. The standardized written instructions for donning and removal of both the PPE and PAPR are attached in Appendices A and B.  All participants will be timed and videotaped during the protective system donning procedure. Timing will commence when the participants are instructed to begin reading 3 their written donning instructions for PPE or when the dressing coach says “begin” for the PAPR. Timing will cease when the participants have completed donning the final item of the protective system being tested. Videotaping will occur in order to record and assist in the detection of any protective system donning procedure violations. A donning procedure violation will be defined as having occurred if the participants perform a donning maneuver out of sequence or touch a piece of protective equipment out of sequence. Participants will be “contaminated” using a solution of fluorescein (1ml of a 25% solution diluted in 100cc sterile water) in a standardized fashion. A Devilbiss atomizer (Model DV-15-RD, Sunrise Medical Products, Carlsbad, California, USA) will be used to apply 5ml of fluorescein solution to the their front face shield and torso. We have chosen these contamination sites in order to simulate areas that would most likely be contaminated by the large respiratory droplets aerosolized by a patient that is either coughing or reacting to intubation attempts or any other high-risk respiratory procedure.  The atomizer nozzle will be held at a distance of 30cm from the participants’ face-shield and will be applied from their shoulder level. The spray stream will be directed at the participants’ nose and then aimed inferiorly towards the their umbilicus in an upwards and downwards sweeping motion while keeping the atomizer oriented in the participants’ mid-saggital plane. Application will occur until the atomizer reservoir is empty. During this application the participants’ eyes will be closed.  “Invisible” Detection Paste (Sirchie, 100 Hunter Place, Youngsville, NC) will be applied to the palmar aspects of the participants’ hands and anterior and posterior forearm to the elbow. Although the paste is labeled “invisible detection paste” it becomes visible when viewed under ultraviolet (UV) light. 15ml of paste will be used. We have chosen to use detection paste on the forearms and gloves of the study participants as these are the areas most likely to come in contact with any patient requiring enhanced contact and respiratory precautions. Participants will be videotaped, photographed with a digital camera, and assessed with a UV lamp (Burton Medical Products Inc, 21100 Lassen Street, Chatsworth, CA. 91311 USA) following contamination to ensure that standardized contamination of their front face shield, torso, forearm, and palmar aspect of the gloved hands has been achieved.  Participants will then follow the standardized written removal procedures for the protective system that they are wearing. They will be timed and videotaped during the protective system removal procedure. Timing will commence when the participants are instructed to begin reading their written removal instructions for PPE or when the dressing coach says “begin” for the PAPR. Timing will be paused during assessments with the UV lamp. Timing will cease when the participants have completed removing the final item of the protective system being tested. Videotaping will occur in order to record and assist in the detection of any protective system removal procedure violations. A removal procedure violation will be defined as having occurred if the participants perform a removal maneuver out of sequence, touch a piece of protective equipment out 4 of sequence, or touch any part of their body other than a piece of protective equipment prior to performing final hand disinfection. Participants will be assessed with the UV lamp at specific intervals during the removal procedure in order to detect any visible contamination. Participants in PPE will be assessed with the UV lamp following removal of the outer PPE protective layer (outer fitted sterile gloves, fluid resistant surgical gown, and faceshield).  Final assessment will occur after removal of the inner PPE protective layer (N95 mask, goggles, bouffant hair cover, inner fitted sterile gloves). Participants in PAPR will be assessed using the UV lamp after removal of the outer PAPR protective layer (PAPR hood and power unit, outer fluid resistant surgical gown, outer boot covers, outer fitted sterile gloves). They will then be assessed after removal of the middle PAPR protective layer (body suit, middle sterile fitted gloves, boot covers).  Final assessment will occur after removal of the inner PAPR protective layer (N95 mask, goggles, bouffant hair cover, inner sterile fitted gloves). An evaluator blinded to the participants’ protective system will perform final assessment.  All areas of the participants’ base clothing layer and any exposed skin and hair will be inspected after removal of the final protective layer. This will include the participants’ face. Contamination episodes will be counted and the contamination area will be calculated in cm2.	0
281	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL765 in combination with erlotinib (Tarceva®) in subjects with solid tumors. XL765 is a new chemical entity that inhibits the kinases PI3K and mTOR. In preclinical studies, inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells, whereas inactivation of mTOR has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Erlotinib is an orally administered inhibitor of EGFR (also known as HER1) tyrosine kinase. It was approved by the FDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and in combination with gemcitabine for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.	0

686	Chloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from national pharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after study commencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic in patients with COVID-19, the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both in the short- and long-term. If successful, treatment with chloroquine has the potential to be the first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of side effects is low, making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population on a global scale.  In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission. The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients with established COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinical outcomes. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms, decreased proportion of patients with clinical deterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for this patient group, studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 are direly needed.  The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients with established COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informing decision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline procedures and data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), pragmatic clinical trials can include a larger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediate need for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal, a pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from the data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e. electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study will accordingly not be placebo-controlled.  All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab, with subsequent microbiological examination, including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from the entirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly, with maximum interval 24 hours, for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects.  The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach, where analyses are planned after the inclusion of 51 patients, with subsequent analyses after 101, 151 and 202 completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the final analyses of the entire study. This approach will enable frequent assessment of all outcome measures.  Data will be collected from the hospital electronic record system, including electronic patient records, laboratory and medical imaging systems, and prescribing systems. The data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital will be utilized for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. All clinical variables will be registered in the study eCRF system, including clinical endpoints and quantitative virological results from serial nasopharyngeal specimens.	0

16	On January 2020, the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was officially announced by the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its complete genome was sequenced by the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur on 29 January 2020 in France. This will allow the identification of antigenic structures involved in the immune response and the development of serological diagnostic tests.  Many questions are being asked about this new virus and the infection it causes, including questions about the percentage of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic forms. Serological studies can provide answers to these questions. There is no serological test for SARS-COV-2 yet, but the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur is working on its development.  We propose to carry out a collection of samples taken from subjects who travelled to China before the epidemic outbreak or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.  As soon as it is available, serology will be performed on the collected samples.	0

293	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new threat to public health since November, 2002. The SARS is highly contagious and is believed to be transmitted by person-to-person through droplet and direct contact. The patients present with fever, chills, cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The symptoms aggravate in the second week and nearly 40% of the patients develop respiratory failure that requires assisted ventilation. The mortality rate is reported as 6.5%-7%.  After several months, the world scientists found the etiology to be a new coronavirus not belonging to the previous coronavirus group I, II and III. The new virus is called SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).  Although the high morbidity and mortality of SARS occurred in adults, there was rare mortality reported in the children. The report from Hong Kong pointed out that the symptoms of SARS in younger children were milder and the clinical course was not as aggressive as in adults. Therefore, the aim of the project is to design the experiment to see the differences of immunological responses to SARS-CoV protein in healthy younger children, teenagers, and adults. The investigators hope that the result could explain the reason for milder disease in younger children and the immunological pathogenesis of SARS.	0

997	2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a novel coronavirus that was initially outbreak in Wuhan, China. Severe acute respiratory infection with novel coronavirus (SARI-nCoV) causes severe acute respiratory failure with substantial mortality. Currently, the standard care is supportive care, and no treatment is proven to be effective for this condition.  Glucocorticoid therapy is widely used among critically ill patients with other coronavirus infection such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). However, whether glucocorticoid improved the outcome of 2019-nConV remains unknown. We hypothesized that glucocorticoid would improve the prognosis of patietns with SARI-nCoV.  In this study, critically ill patients with 2019-nConV were enrolled and randomized to receive ether standard care or standard care in combination with methylprednisolone therapy. The primary outcome is the difference of Murray lung injury score between two groups.	0

434	This study will assess the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis on immunosuppressant therapy.	0
110	This study will evaluate and treat people with SARS, a new type of pneumonia (lung infection) originating in China. SARS is caused by a new virus that is easily transmitted from person to person. This study will look at the course of the disease; determine how the virus affects the body and how the body fights the infection; and evaluate diagnostic tests to quickly identify the disease.  People 18 years of age and older with probable or suspected SARS may be eligible for this study. Close contacts of patients with SARS, patients who recovered from SARS, and NIH health care workers involved in the care of patients will also be enrolled. Patients with SARS who require hospitalization will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Because SARS spreads easily, hospitalized patients will be in a room by themselves and will not be allowed any visitors. They will not leave their room except for tests, such as x-rays.  All participants will have a full medical examination, including a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. In addition, the participants undergo various tests and procedures as follows:  Probable and suspected SARS patients may be hospitalized or may be seen as outpatients. They are provided the treatment judged best for their disease, usually according to expressed or published recommendations. The best treatment for SARS is not yet known, and there have been no studies evaluating therapies. Outpatients are seen three times a week for 2 weeks, once a week for 4 more weeks, and then at 6 months. Patients have mouth and throat swabs taken three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once a week for 4 more weeks. Blood is drawn three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once at weeks 3, 4, and 6. If virus is still detectable after 6 weeks, nose washings and throat swabs are repeated until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. In addition, patients provide urine and stool samples, have a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram, and undergo bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage. For the bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope (pencil-thin flexible tube) is passed into the large airways of the lung, allowing the physician to examine the airways. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed from the lung with salt water. A brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways and pieces of tissue are collected for analysis. Close contacts of patients are evaluated twice a week for 2 weeks, then once a week for 2 more weeks. Blood is drawn at the first visit and then at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Mouth and throat swabs, nose washings, and sputum collections are done twice a week for 2 weeks, then once a week for 2 more weeks. Urine and stool samples are collected once a week for 4 weeks. If virus from the nose or throat is still detectable after 4 weeks, weekly nose washings and throat swabs continue until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. Blood may also be drawn during the weekly visits. Recovered SARS patients provide blood, urine, and stool samples and have a mouth and throat swab and nose aspiration to see if the SARS virus is present. For the nasal aspiration, salt water is put in the nose and then suctioned out. Usually, these tests are done only once. If virus is detected, however, the nose washing, throat swabs and blood tests are repeated once a week until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. Health care workers document their contact with patients, use of isolation procedures and equipment, and any unexpected events that occur during contact. They are evaluated for symptoms of infection and provide a blood sample once a month	0
510	The duration of the study for the patients will include a period for screening of up to 14 days. The cycle duration is 42 days. Patients will continue study treatment as long as clinical benefit is possible or until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction, patient's decision to stop treatment, or other reason of discontinuation. After study treatment discontinuation patients will return to the study site 30 days after the last administration of SAR440234 for end of treatment assessments. Patients without documented disease progression at the end of a treatment visit who have not yet started treatment with another anti-cancer therapy will proceed with monthly follow-up visits until initiation of another anti-cancer therapy, disease progression, or study cut-off date, whichever comes first.	0

809	This study is a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of treatments of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. The study is a multi-centre/country trial that will be conducted in various sites in Europe with Inserm as sponsor. Adults (≥18 year-old) hospitalized for COVID-19 with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air OR acute respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support will be randomized between 4 treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care (SoC) in the participating hospital: SoC alone versus SoC + Remdesivir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon ß-1a versus SoC + Hydroxychloroquine. Randomization will be stratified by European region and severity of illness at enrollment (moderate disease: patients NOT requiring non-invasive ventilation NOR high flow oxygen devices NOR invasive mechanical ventilation NOR ECMO and severe disease: patients requiring non-invasive ventilation OR high flow oxygen devices OR invasive mechanical ventilation OR ECMO). The interim trial results will be monitored by a Data Monitoring Committee, and if at any stage evidence emerges that any one treatment arm is definitely inferior then it will be centrally decided that that arm will be discontinued. Conversely, if good evidence emerges while the trial is continuing that some other treatment(s) should also be being evaluated then it will be centrally decided that one or more extra arms will be added while the trial is in progress. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the primary endpoint is subject clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate 1) the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by clinical severity (7-point ordinal scale, national early warning score, oxygenation, mechanical ventilation), hospitalization, mortality through 28 days of follow-up, in-hospital mortality and 90-day mortality 2) the safety of different investigational therapeutics through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by the cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), the cumulative incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), the discontinuation or temporary suspension of antiviral drugs (for any reason), and the changes in blood white cell count, haemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, blood electrolytes, prothrombine time and international normalized ratio (INR), glucose, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) over time.	0

502	"Severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease that was first recognized in Guangdong Province, China, in November of 2002. Efforts to prevent the spread of this virus stopped the epidemic in July, 2003, but over 8,000 cases had occurred and almost 800 people died. A new virus, a coronavirus, was shown to be the cause and it is believed to be a virus of bats that infected some animals that, in turn, infected people and they gave it to other people. While it is unlikely to again become epidemic, the virus is thought to be a risk for spread to humans if it was released intentionally by a terrorist group. For that reason, the U.S. government is developing vaccines and drugs for use if spread should occur again. This study will test the safety and protective responses to a vaccine against SARS made by a vaccine company for this study. This protocol concerns Phase I clinical testing of an inactivated, purified SARS Coronavirus (CoV) vaccine administered with and without aluminum hydroxide (Alum) adjuvant. The rationale for development of vaccines against SARS-CoV is to provide a means of control in the event a new SARS-CoV epidemic occurs or there is a deliberate release of the virus. Inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine has been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies that block binding of the virus to its receptor, ACE2. The primary objectives of the study are to assess: reactogenicity of escalating doses of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted, inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine among healthy young adult subjects given their first intramuscular (IM) vaccinations with this vaccine; reactogenicity of a repeat IM administration of the same material to healthy young adult subjects one month later; and development and persistence of immune responses to escalating doses of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted, inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine 1 and 5 months after the second (""booster"") vaccination. The secondary objective of this study is to assess immune responses to each vaccine 1 month after a single dose. This is a single center, Phase I, out-patient study of the reactogenicity (tolerability and safety) and immunogenicity of escalating doses of an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with and without aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Each vaccine will be injected as primary and booster vaccinations a month apart in the subject's non-dominant deltoid muscle. Participants will include 72 healthy males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, 18-40 years old from the Houston, Texas area. The study will be conducted at Baylor College of Medicine in 2 sequential stages. This study consists of a preliminary dose-escalation stage (1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) followed by a dose comparison stage (2) as follows: Stage 1a (2.5 mcg), 7 subjects randomized in a 1:3:3 fashion to receive a 2 dose regimen of placebo, vaccine containing 2.5 mcg of antigen and no adjuvant, or 2.5 mcg of antigen and Alum adjuvant; Stage 1b (5.0 mcg), 7 subjects randomized in a 1:3:3 fashion to receive a 2 dose regimen of placebo, vaccine containing 5.0 mcg of antigen and no adjuvant, or 5.0 mcg of antigen and Alum adjuvant; Stage 1c (10.0 mcg), 4 subjects randomized in a 1:3 fashion to receive a 2 dose regimen of placebo or vaccine with 10 mcg of antigen and no adjuvant; Stage 2, 54 subjects (9 per vaccine group) randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive vaccines containing, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mcg of antigen without adjuvant, or 2.5 or 5.0 mcg of antigen with Alum, or placebo."	0

411	Following the sudden and unexpected emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009 H1N1) virus, this observational study was initiated to estimate rates of morbidity and mortality and to examine predictors of severity among participants with 2009 H1N1 infection. In 2011, as surveillance indicated that 2009 H1N1 virus was co-circulating with other seasonal influenza A and B viruses worldwide, the protocol was expanded to include other influenza A subtypes and influenza B viruses. The current version of the protocol (released in August 2013) further broadens the scope of this observational study. With the recognition that novel respiratory viruses other than novel influenza A viruses, e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), could become prevalent and of major public health importance, the objectives of this protocol have been expanded.	0

381	This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 75 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19.	0

178	There has not been any systemic therapy approved in the United States or in Europe for treating advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC). This study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of XL147 in advanced or recurrent EC.  Constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) pathway signaling is common in EC and involved in the development and/or progression of the disease. PTEN deficiency and/or activating mutations/amplification in the PIK3CA gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K have been frequently detected in EC patients. XL147 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the Class I PI3K family of lipid kinases. In addition, in vivo preclinical data have demonstrated that XL147 targets both proximal and distal signaling in the PI3K/PTEN pathway. Therefore, XL147 may have utility in the treatment of subjects with advanced or recurrent EC.	0

192	Severe acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. It is caused by a novel SARS-associated coronavirus. According to the epidemiological data, it is highly infectious by intimate contact, respiratory secretion, or direct contact with infectious body fluid. By June 1, 2003, Center for Disease Control Taiwan, R.O.C reported 677 probable SARS cases. Among them, 93.2% (631/677) were more than 20 years old. Only 6.8% (46/677) were under 20 years old. Usually the major hosts of respiratory viruses are children, but evidence up to now shows that SARS is mainly a disease of adults. The data of clinical presentation and epidemiological prevalence in teenage group and children are lacking. Therefore, this project is aimed at the children and teenager among 1 month to eighteen years old. Seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV infection in children would be investigated. Patients who admitted to pediatric wards or visited ER and received blood sampling due to the need of clinical diagnosis/management would be enrolled. After the necessary laboratory examinations were done, the remaining serum would be collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV IgG by ELISA.	0

962	There is now a global epidemic of diabetes and obesity affecting more than 300 million people worldwide with Asia in the forefront. In Hong Kong, diabetes affects more than 10% of the population. Patients with diabetes have a 12—25% lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer. These silent conditions independently and collectively contribute to 50% of all causes of death mainly due to cardiovascular and renal complications. Type 2 diabetes is a complex disorder characterized by a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors, notably, hyperglycemia, obesity, dyslipidemia (high triglyceride (TG) and low HDL-C), hypertension, microinflammation and prothrombotic state, often referred to as the metabolic syndrome. The public health implication of diabetes lies mainly in its devastating chronic complications due to generalized vascular dysfunction. In patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome, loss of cellular structure or function due to apoptosis, angiogenesis and fibrosis eventually manifest as overt diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy.  The abnormal metabolic milieus of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, pro-thrombotic state and chronic inflammation in diabetes causes atherosclerosis. A significant proportion of subjects have underlying peripheral arterial disease and neuropathy. These subjects are at great risk of developing infective foot ulceration secondary to impaired vascular supply, sensory loss and minor trauma. Without prompt and proper medical treatment, these infective ulcers will deteriorate leading to gangrene and limb amputation. Age, wound depth, the presence of ischaemia, a low albumin level, and the lack of simultaneous ulceration are the most significant independent predictors of an unfavourable outcome. The conventional management of diabetic foot ulcer includes rest, antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement and good glycemic control. The investigators previously demonstrated that the use of a recipe containing 12 herbs was effective in promoting the healing of severe chronic non-healing diabetic foot ulcers and achieved an 85% of limb preservation. In-vitro and in-vivo studies revealed that 5 out of the 12 herbs were effective in promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis. To minimize potential drug interactions and adverse effects from multiple components in a recipe of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the investigators have developed a simplified formula from the 12 herbs consisting of only two herbs.  Many herbs have long been used to treat diabetes mellitus and its complications. In many of these successful attempts Radix Rehmanniae (RR) and Radix Astragali (RA) have frequently been used in combination with other herbs to form complex formulae such as 'blood-house blood stasis-dispelling decoction with additive ingredients' and 'pills of six drugs with Rehmannia'.  Based on our previous in-vitro and in-vivo studies, a new reformulated recipe of herbal medicine has been developed. In this proof-of-concept study, the investigators hypothesize that the novel recipe of herbal medicine will expedite healing of early foot ulcer by promoting vascularisation and granulation as well as modulating inflammatory response. Results will provide valuable insight and understanding of the application of TCM in the management of diabetic foot ulcer, in particular, the effect on angiogenesis and anti-inflammation. New intellectual properties will be developed and provide the foundation for future research. Such an integrated approach from bench to bedside will serve as a model platform for the development of TCM in Hong Kong.  The study will investigate whether the two-herb recipe can increase the wound healing of patients with diabetes mellitus.  Primary outcome:  Resolution/progression of foot ulcer based on PEDIS Failure of treatment i.e. no improvement in 6 months, rapid deterioration or emergency surgery required  Secondary outcome:  Hospital admission/attendance/stay Metabolic parameters	0

118	"Modelling repurposed from pandemic influenza is currently informing all strategies for SARS-CoV-2 and the disease COVID-19. A customized disease specific understanding will be important to understand subsequent disease waves, vaccine development and therapeutics. For this reason, ISARIC (the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) was set up in advance. This focuses on hospitalised and convalescent serum samples to understand severe illness and associated immune response. However, many subjects are seroconverting with mild or even subclinical disease. Information is needed about subclinical infection, the significance of baseline immune status and the earliest immune changes that may occur in mild disease to compare with those of SARS-CoV-2. There is also a need to understand the vulnerability and response to COVID-19 of the NHS workforce of healthcare workers (HCWs). HCW present a cohort with likely higher exposure and seroconversion rates than the general population, but who can be followed up with potential for serial testing enabling an insight into early disease and markers of risk for disease severity. We have set up ""COVID-19: Healthcare worker Bioresource: Immune Protection and Pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2"". This urgent fieldwork aims to secure significant (n=400) sampling of healthcare workers (demographics, swabs, blood sampling) at baseline, and weekly whilst they are well and attending work, with acute sampling (if hospitalised, via ISARIC, if their admission hospital is part of the ISARIC network) and convalescent samples post illness. These will be used to address specific questions around the impact of baseline immune function, the earliest immune responses to infection, and the biology of those who get non-hospitalized disease for local research and as a national resource. The proposal links directly with other ongoing ISARIC and community COVID projects sampling in children and the older age population. Reasonable estimates suggest the usable window for baseline sampling of NHS HCW is closing fast (e.g. baseline sampling within 3 weeks)."	0
996	"Data management The electronic data collection system (EDC) will be used in this study for the collection and management of the study data to ensure the traceability of the clinical trial data; the data management process shall comply with the GCP specification to ensure the authenticity, integrity and accuracy of clinical trial data. The main data management processes are listed below. For other details, please refer to the data management plan (DMP).  DMP is written by the data manager (DM) as the guiding document for data management.

During the coding process, DM can question the investigator online in real time about failure of coding caused by improper, inaccurate or ambiguous medical terms provided.  A medical review is required for the medical coding before the database lock. 1.6External data management NA 1.7Data review meeting The study leader, statistician and data manager make the data review before statistical analysis to review the subject completion, protocol violation, adverse events, analysis data sets (including FAS, PPS and SS) to determine the attribution of each subject, judgment of missing value and treatment of outliers. Decisions made on the review meeting cannot be modified after the database lock, and any decisions must be documented.  1.8Electronic signature of investigator After the database is frozen, the investigator conducts electronic signature verification and shall sign the name again in case of data revision after signature.  1.9Data lock and export After the data in the database meets the quality requirements, a written approval document of database lock is signed by the data manager, statistical analyst and investigator representative according to the database lock procedures, exported by the data manager to the database of specified format and submitted to the statistician for statistical analysis.  Statistical analysis See the ""Statistical analysis plan"" for the details of the statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan.  2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once.  2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report.  2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization.  2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in.  2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle  Description of statistics:  The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like.  Statistical test:  Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters.  2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined.  A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated.  The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS.  2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis.  The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated.  2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS.  Primary efficiency indicators:  The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis.  Secondary efficiency indicators:  The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90% confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression.  2.3.5Safety analysis SS data sets are used for safety analysis. Adverse events are coded according to the MedDRA. The occurrence of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is summarized and analyzed in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence).  The occurrence of varying severity orders of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is subject to descriptive statistical analysis in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence) according to SOC and PT.  A detailed list of various adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is made.  Changes in the clinical significance determination of laboratory indicators, ECG and physical examination at each visit after administration and baseline test results are described in the form of crosstab.  The laboratory indexes and vital signs examination are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to trial grouping and visits.  A detailed list of laboratory indexes, ECG, and clinically significant physical abnormalities is made.  2.4Analysis software Use the software SAS with version 9.4 or above for analysis. 2.5Interim analysis and multiplicity control In order to obtain relevant study results as soon as possible to support follow-up scientific research and clinical practice, this study plans to conduct staged efficacy and safety data analysis at the sample size of 65, 130 and 260 cases.

500	This study will investigate immune responses, transmission and nucleotide polymorphisms in families with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infections. Study objectives are to: develop an immune response profile to SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) among SARS survivors; ascertain whether there was spread of SARS CoV within the family and whether significant disease resulted; and determine whether 1 or more nucleotide polymorphisms relate to occurrence and severity of SARS CoV disease or immunologic responses. Up to 1,000 persons residing in Beijing, China, will participate in this study and will include the following groups: 200 adult (greater than or equal to18 years of age) subjects, previously experiencing SARS caused by SARS Coronavirus; their household/family members, including children ages 4 and up (male or female); and an additional 200 adults matched for characteristics (age, gender, health status and housing/work location) of the 200 SARS survivors. As much as possible (for DNA tests), these controls will be persons involved in health care with a possible SARS exposure during the epidemic. Blood will be obtained from all subjects and used for SARS CoV antibody assays. Additional studies will be performed with blood specimens from selected subjects. Tests for serum antibodies will be used to identify infected persons in each family. For any who possess specific antibodies, a review of their health and clinic/hospital visit records for the SARS epidemic period will be conducted to identify any illness, its type and severity. A control for interpretation can be illnesses during the study period in uninfected family members. Data will be analyzed by age, gender, and health status of family members, the severity of SARS illness in the index case and the time of return to the home environment. The illness data will be obtained from medical records and not from subject memory. To assess health status, subjects for this study will have a chest x-ray performed and 15 mL of blood obtained for complete blood counts, liver function, to include ALT, and creatinine. For study purposes, 30 to 100 mL of blood will be collected from SARS survivors and from 50 matched controls (age, gender and health status). Illnesses from medical records will be characterized for severity and will include extent of x-ray changes, need for oxygen therapy, medical care in the intensive care unit and extent of leukocyte changes. Microarray chips that contain human genes determining immune responses, production of cytokines and chemokines and a number of other potential responses to illness have been constructed. PureGene kits will be provided for isolation of DNA from blood specimens for testing for polymorphisms. These analyses will be performed on the 200 SARS survivors, the 200 matched controls and on family members. The DNA samples will be shipped to laboratories at Baylor College of Medicine for analysis using the microarray chips.	0

875	Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event, especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over 10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute respiratory impairment.  Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.  Although human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use.  The purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).	0

854	Fat tissue obtainment:  Subjects will undergo liposuction under local anesthesia. In this procedure, Ringer's solution with the anesthetic lidocaine and vasoconstrictor adrenaline infused into the adipose compartment to minimize blood loss and contamination of the tissue by peripheral blood cells. 15 minutes later a hollow blunt-tipped 3 mm cannula introduced into the subcutaneous space through small (0.5 cm) incision. The cannula attached to syringe and under gentle suction moved through the adipose compartment, mechanically disrupting the fat tissue. Aspirate volume - approximately 150-200 cc. Procedure time - 30 minutes.  ADRC isolation:  Aspirated fat tissue placed into sterile vessel which inserted into Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) - closed system for automated and standardized extraction and concentration of ADRC. Celution 800/CRS System drains excess of fluid from fat tissue and estimate it's volume After that lipoaspirate washed extensively with equal volumes of Ringer's solution to remove blood. At the end of this process System indicates required volume of enzyme reagent (Celase®) which should be added immediately by operator. After enzyme treatment Celution 800/CRS System automatically transfers isolated ADRC into washing compartment where ADRC washed and concentrated in 5 mL suspension. Tissue processing time - approximately 60 minutes. ADRC suspension match all requirements listed in technical documentation for Celution 800/CRS System. Obtained ADRC divided into 2 portions. First portion (0.2-0.5 mL) used for counting, viability and sterility assessment. Second portion placed into sterile syringe for injection.  Subtenon injection of ADRC:  Antiseptic and anesthetic solutions instilled into conjunctival sac. After that blepharostat installed. The patient is asked to look in opposite to the injection side direction. Doctor inserts a needle into inferior temporal quadrant between rectus muscles,10-12 mm from the limbus. Needle should be moved slowly, as close as possible to the eyeball. After needle placement at the depth of 5-7 mm doctor injects concentrated solution of ADRC (up to 0,5 ml per single injection). Injection is made by insulin syringe with a needle size 0.45 mm * 12mm (26 G).	0

449	In December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China, a series of patients with unclear pneumonia was noticed, some of whom have died of it. In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan at the beginning of 2020 and soon beyond in China and, in the coming weeks, around the world.  Initial studies described numerous severe courses, particularly those associated with increased patient age and previous cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. A small number of the particularly severely ill patients required not only highly invasive ventilation therapy but also extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) to supply the patient's blood with sufficient oxygen.  Even under maximum intensive care treatment, a very high mortality rate of approximately 80-100% was observed in this patient group. In addition, high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) could be detected in the blood of these severely ill patients, which in turn were associated with poor outcome.  From experience in the therapy of severely ill patients with severe infections and respiratory failure, we know that treatment with a CytoSorb® adsorber can lead to a reduction of the circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and thus improve the course of the disease and the outcome of the patients.  Our primary goal is to investigate the efficacy of treatment with a CytoSorb® adsorber in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring venous ECMO over 72 hours after initiation of ECMO. The primary endpoint is the reduction of plasma interleukin-6 levels 72 hours after initiation of ECMO support. As secondary endpoints we investigate 30-day survival, vasopressor and volume requirements, lactate in terms of lactate and platelet function. As safety variables, we further investigate the levels of the applied antibiotics (usually ampicillin and sulbactam).	0

723	In their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected.  The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving).  Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation.  Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved.  Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2.  Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19.  Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm.  Blinding. The treatment is not masked.	0

783	The study will take place in a quarantine facility. Some volunteers (Donors) will be infected with the influenza virus via droplets into the nose. Other volunteers (Recipients) will then be exposed to them by occupying the same room (in the day time) and taking part in certain activities e.g. playing card games. Some of the Recipients will wear face shields and clean their hands regularly during the times they are with the Donors. The wearing of face shields together with good hand hygiene should reduce the spread of infection through large respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces but will not prevent infection that occurs through aerosols in the air. Use of symptom diaries and diagnostic tests for influenza will allow the presence of subsequent illness to be identified. Volunteers will be required to participate in the quarantine facility for up to approximately 13 days (typically 9 for Donors and 13 days for Recipients), plus study screening clinics and followup.  Additionally, during the study, environmental sampling will be performed looking for the presence of influenza virus. Air sampling and swabbing of surfaces and objects may provide information enabling us to better understand the routes of transmission.	0
342	The goal of this study was to determine the effect on overall survival and progression free survival by adding iniparib (BSI-201/SAR240550) to the combination of gemcitabine/carboplatin in adult patients with triple negative breast cancer (estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative).  Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.	0

18	The epidemic due to the Sars-CoV2 virus is spreading in France, without knowning precisely since when the virus has actually circulated on the territory. Data from China but also systematic samples taken from the passengers of the Diamond Princess boat also report almost 50% of asymptomatic forms of Covid-19. The medical and paramedical staff of the front-line services for the care of patients infected with Covid-19 are in fact potentially exposed to the risk of occupational contamination due to the large number of patients treated, including in the pre-epidemic phase. Therefore, and despite the application of standard protective measures, it is possible that a certain number of these personnel already have or will contract Covid-19 disease, including in its asymptomatic form.	0

179	Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in combination with letrozole (Femara) and of XL765 when given in combination with letrozole. After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in subjects with breast cancer refractory to a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that is ER+/PGR+ and HER2-. Letrozole is used in the treatment of different types of breast cancer, but patients can develop resistance.  Upregulation of PI3K activity is one of the most common characteristics of human cancer cells, including breast tumor cells. Activation of PI3K results in stimulation of AKT and mTOR kinases, resulting in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation and survival. Preclinical and retrospective clinical data suggest that aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway may play a role in aromatase inhibitor resistance in patients with ER+, HER2- breast cancer. XL147 is a potent inhibitor of PI3K, and XL765 is a potent dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR; therefore either of these compounds in combination with letrozole warrants clinical investigation.	0

932	"Allergic rhinitis is a nasal inflammatory disorder initiated by an immunoglobulin-E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity to allergens. This condition is characterized by sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching and congestion. When a patient is exposed to an allergen to which they are sensitive, the allergen cross-links with the Ig E antibody, which is bound to the surface of tissue mast cells. This cross-linking then triggers the release of proinflammatory substances, such as histamine and eicosanoids, and is known as the early response. In a skin prick test, this reaction produces a wheal-and-flare response. Normally, systemic exposure to an allergen also leads to the more prolonged late reaction, in which eosinophils, basophils, and activated T cells are recruited to the site of exposure. The recruited T cells also secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5, typically associated with helper T cells type 2 (TH2), which further propagate the inflammatory cascade. Typically, the early response occurs within 15 to 30 minutes (but as quickly as a few seconds) and usually resolves within 1 to 3 hours, and the late response occurs within 6 to 12 hours and resolves in 24 hours.  Allergic vaccination (AV), also referred to as immunotherapy or allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), is a curative approach that is available for allergic diseases, which directly treats the underlying disease. AV is the practice of administering gradually increasing quantities of an allergen extract to an allergic patient to ameliorate the symptoms associated with the subsequent exposure to the causative allergen. AV is believed to exert its beneficial effects on the immune system, at least in part, by modifying the T-lymphocyte response to subsequent natural allergen exposure. AV has been shown to inhibit both early and late responses to allergen exposure. AV acts on T cells to modify peripheral and mucosal TH2 responses to allergen in favor of helper T cell type 1 (TH1) responses. One of the hallmarks of successful AV is the redressing of a ""healthy"" TH1/TH2-balance.  Although efficacious, immunotherapy is generally considered a long-term disease modifying measure that requires months to years of treatment, entails multiple injection regimens and involves some risk for adverse immune reactions.  Recent improvements, such as optimal dosing, allergen modification (to reduce allergenicity while maintaining immunogenicity), adjuvant adsorption (to control release) and adjuvant activity (to assist immunomodulatory action) are being explored to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis and decrease the commitment to multiple injections.  A novel allergy vaccine (Ragweed MATAMPL) has been developed for the prevention or relief of allergic symptoms caused by a variety of pollens. Ragweed MATAMPL, which contains the allergens of ragweed (chemically modified by glutaraldehyde) adsorbed onto L-tyrosine with the addition of the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), is being evaluated for the specific treatment of ragweed seasonally induced allergic rhinitis. Ragweed MATAMPL is intended for use as a pre-seasonal therapeutic allergy vaccine in patients with proven seasonal allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis due to IgE mediated allergy to ragweed. This novel vaccine formulation is designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only four escalating dose injections, in contrast to the longer schedules currently in use.  This placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ragweed MATAMPL as determined by patient symptomatic response to pollen and patient quality of life in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC) that reproduces the clinical setting. The development of the EEC, which delivers a controlled pollen challenge over time and allows evaluation of a patient's response at any time point throughout the challenge process, provides the opportunity to examine various aspects of efficacy of anti-allergic treatments within a single center at various times of the year. The EEC affords a more controlled environment than natural pollen exposure in which variables such as unpredictable pollen levels, varying weather conditions during the study period, and varying levels of pollen exposure within the patient population are eliminated. Furthermore, the question of patient compliance is largely eliminated because the patients are scrutinized closely while they are recording symptoms. In addition, an EEC study is an acceptable study model for determining the dose response for an allergic rhinitis drug as outlined in the draft U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines ""Allergic Rhinitis Clinical Development Programs for Drug Products,"" April 2000."	0
658	The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of up to 21 days.

677	"All patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute encephalopathy at presentation will be prospectively included in the NEURO-COVD-19 study. This study will collect demographic data, clinical examen at prehospital/emergency room and ICU admission (including neurological signs), and all ancillary exams performed to identify a cause of neurological impairment. Outcome will be evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at ICU and hospital discharge, and day-90 after ICU admission.  Acute encephalopathy will be defined as recently stated :  ""1. The term acute encephalopathy refers to a rapidly developing (over less than 4 weeks, but usually within hours to a few days) pathobiological process in the brain. This is a preferred term 2. Acute encephalopathy can lead to a clinical presentation of subsyndromal delirium, delirium, or in case of a severely decreased level of consciousness, coma; all representing a change from baseline cognitive status 3. The term delirium refers to a clinical state characterized by a combination of features defined by diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5. Delirium according to the DSM-5 is defined if criterium A-E are fulfilled: A. Disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). B. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days) represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of the day. C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception). D. The disturbances in criteria A and C are not explained by another pre-existing, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder, and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma.

963	COVID-19 is a massive threat to public health worldwide. Current estimates suggest that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive rate, 2-3) and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality rate, 0.5-5%). Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently needed.  Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro, hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus chloroquine.  Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously, hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases.  This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19 symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 epidemic.  This is a trial of hydroxychloroquine PEP among adult household contacts of COVID-19 patients in New York City (NYC). The trial will be initiated at NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP)/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).	0

287	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The median time from onset of symptoms of COVID-19 to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported as short as 9 days. No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. According to data from the Danish Health Authority (www.sst.dk/corona), as of March 21st, 2020, there were 1326 patients infected with the disease in Denmark, more than 250 are admitted to a hospital, and >50 of them have required intensive care. Nearly 350.000 cases and 15.000 deaths have been reported globally. These numbers are likely to markedly increase during the coming weeks, challenging the capacity of health systems worldwide.  In patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it has been described that disease severity and outcomes are related to the characteristics of the immune response. Interleukin (IL)-6 and other components of the inflammatory cascade contribute to host defense against infections. However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as 'cytokine storm'. In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study found that a cytokine storm involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Studies on the Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate that cytokine genes of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 can be markedly upregulated. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and TNF-α. These findings indicate that the magnitude and characteristics of the cytokine response is related to the severity and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.  It has been suggested that IL-6 blockade may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for other types of cytokine storm, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Remarkable beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a IL-6 receptor inhibitor has been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a retrospective case series from China.  Currently, there are two available drugs based on human monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) and sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi). IL-6 receptor inhibitors are currently licensed for several autoimmune disorders and are considered well tolerated and safe in general. The most common side effects reported are upper respiratory tract infections, headache, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious side effects are serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.  it is hypothesized that IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm associated with serious adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and that blockade of IL-6 would be suitable therapeutic target for these patients. The study will investigate the effect of different types of IL-6 inhibition versus no adjuvant treatment compared to standard of care in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.  Primary objective: To compare the effect of either one of three IL-6 inhibitor administrations, relative to the standard of care, on time to independence from supplementary oxygen therapy, measured in days from baseline to day 28, in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.	0

704	Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune response of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to the SARS coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) protein. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the study vaccine.  Product Description: VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP is composed of a single closed, circular DNA plasmid that is based on the S protein of SARS-CoV. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System.  Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 50 years old) will be enrolled.  Study Plan: Ten volunteers will be enrolled and receive 3 injections on the schedule shown in the schema. The protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up contacts.  Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.  Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary immunogenicity endpoints are an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for SARS specific T cell responses and an assay for antibody-dependent enhancement of virus uptake. The principal timepoints for ICS are Week 0 (baseline) and Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12. ICS at other study timepoints, as well as other immunogenicity assays through Week 32, will be completed as exploratory evaluations.	0

814	Patients will be registered for through the study Web site. Following Web site registration, patients will receive an electronic informed consent form. Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual's agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual's study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved and the participant will read and review the document electronically. Participants must sign the informed consent document prior to participating in the registry. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice by emailing the study team.  As a real-world data registry, any adult men and women currently in the United States and willing to provide written informed consent and:  who are feeling sick but have not tested positive for COVID-19, or who are feeling sick and have tested positive for COVID-19, or who are not feeling sick but want to participate can enroll  Patients unwilling or unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.  DATA MANAGEMENT A registry database will be maintained with identified registry data elements captured into the REDCap Cloud EDC system, a commercial eClinical Platform that is 21 CFR Part 11 Validated, HIPAA & FISMA compliant, and WHODrug and MedDRA certified. All access and activity in the system is tracked and can easily be monitored by the Administrator. The system has a login audit feature that tracks who has logged into the system, the date and time of login, and the IP address of the connection. The system also tracks failed logins and automatically locks a user's account after several failed attempts. The REDCap Cloud system has a robust audit trail that shows all changes to any records within the system including who made the change, the date and time of the change, the field that was changed, the old value of the field and the new value of the field. Access can be monitored via a dashboard or email alerts. Data management activities will follow standard operating procedures.  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION In the event that patient authorize the collection of additional medical records, those records will be maintained in xCures' HIPAA compliant box storage platform hosted on Amazon's HIPAA-compliant cloud servers. Source information, including medical records will be abstracted into a study database and not made available in their original format outside the study team. Study data including source records and case reports forms will be maintained in electronic format indefinitely. De-identified databases derived from the study records may be made available to other researchers and may be retained by those organizations indefinitely based on the terms of the agreement under which the data was provided.  SOURCE DOCUMENTS Source data can include clinical findings and observations, or other information incorporated into the registry database to support analysis of data. Source data is all information from which information in the registry database is derived in original form (or certified copies of an original record). Examples of these original documents and records include but are not limited to the following: electronic medical records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, correspondence, subjects' diaries or patient-reported questionnaires, data from automated instruments, such as ECG machines, photographs and other imaging (DICOM) files, slides, pharmacy records, and the reports documenting medical interpretation of those files.  Data may be entered into the eCRF either manually by the study team performing data abstraction from the EMR or electronically using direct entry of data into the or from an electronic import of data. Patients may also enter information directly into the eCRF using a patient-facing survey functionality either over the Web or using a smartphone app. Data elements originating in EMR may be automatically transmitted directly into the eCRF using a suitable API. Source data derived in that manner may have an intervening process, such as abstraction by third-party including software including processing using machine learning algorithms prior to transferring to the eCRF. xCures will retain source records in a secure that will be maintained separately and securely from the eCRF. However, metadata tagging may be employed to electronically map source data back from the eCRF to the source data record to create an audit trail.  DISCONTINUATION OF PARTICIPATION  Participants can withdraw from the registry at any time by sending a written request to xCures. Withdrawal from the study means that no additional data will be collected from the patient and does not constitute revocation of the right to use the data collected prior to withdrawal for the purposes described herein. xCures may discontinue the study at any time for any reason. In the event the registry is discontinued enrolled participants may receive an email notification and a public posting on the study Web site will be made, if possible.	0

379	The overall objective of the study is to determine the therapeutic effect and tolerance of Sarilumab in patients with moderate, severe pneumonia or critical pneumonia associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sarilumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6Rs (sIL-6Rα and mIL-6Rα) and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. The study has a cohort multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur prior to offering Sarilumab administration to patients enrolled in the CORIMUNO-19 cohort. Sarilumab will be administered to consenting adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 either diagnosed with moderate or severe pneumonia requiring no mechanical ventilation or critical pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients who will chose not to receive Sarilumab will receive standard of care. Outcomes of Sarilumab-treated patients will be compared with outcomes of standard of care-treated patients as well as with outcomes of patients treated with other immune modulators.	0
203	Since Dec 2019, over 70000 novel coronavirus infection pneumonia (NCIP) patients were confirmed. 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is a RNA virus, which spread mainly from person-to-person contact. Most of the symptoms are non-specific, including fever, fatigue, dry cough. Sever NCIP patients may have shortness of breath and dyspnea, and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The mortality is reported to be around 2.3%. Thus, early detection and early treatment is very important to the improvement of NCIP patients' prognosis. At present, NCIP RNA detection of pharyngeal swab specimen by RT-PCR is recommended. However, due to the universal susceptibility to 2019 nCoV in general population and limited number of NCIP RNA detection kits available, to identify an efficient screening strategy is urgently needed. This study aim to develop and validate the diagnostic accuracy and screening efficiency of a new NCIP screening strategy, which can benefit the disease prevention and control.	0

518	The epidemic due to Sars-CoV2 is spreading in France, without it being knowning precisely since when the virus actually circulated on the territory. Data from China but also systematic samples taken from the passengers of the boat Diamond Princess also report almost 50% of asymptomatic forms of Covid-19. Medical and paramedical staff are in fact potentially exposed to the risk of professional contamination, with probably a different risk between the first-line referent hospitals and the others, due to the large number of patients treated in the first, including in the pre-epidemic phase (average of 190 consultants per day at the emergency department Pitié-Salpêtrière for example). Therefore, and despite the application of standard protective measures, it is possible that a certain number of these personnel already have or will contract Covid-19 disease, including in its asymptomatic form. Knowledge of this seroconversion rate, if it is found to be higher than that of the general population, could lead to a review of the measures to protect personnel from other emerging infectious risks.	0

934	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has hit Northern Italy (including the Veneto region) particularly hard, causing several deaths and putting a huge strain on the Italian National Healthcare System. In the absence of specific treatments, preventing the infection from spreading remains the only effective measure. There is a lot of apprehension both from doctors (including dermatologists, rheumatologists and gastroenterologists) and their patients that immunosuppressive medications (biologics, methotrexate, ciclosporin and corticosteroids) might lead to an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection or negatively influence the course of the infection. However, there is currently a lack of scientific evidence to recommend whether immunosuppressive treatments should or should not be continued in patients who have no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Besides, treatment discontinuation would cause flare-ups of diseases - such as plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases - which are invalidating and have a relatively high prevalence in the Veneto population. In the Unit of Dermatology of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Intergrata di Verona alone, more than 2000 patients are currently being treated with immunosuppressive agents. As of now, there are no data available on the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with immune-mediated diseases, nor can data from randomized clinical trials be extrapolated to the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in patients on biologic drugs. This study aims to assess the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis on immunosuppressive therapy and to identify associated risk factors. Such data would prove invaluable for clinicians dealing with patients on immunosuppressive agents during the coronavirus outbreak.	0

610	Since mid February 2003, there have been reports of atypical pneumonias originating in China which have subsequently been termed the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS has subsequently spread to multiple countries including the United States, and is accompanied by a higher than anticipated morbidity and mortality. Because of world travel and the apparent easy transmissibility of this disease reported in other nations, the number of patients with SARS may continue to rise. The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate and treat persons with SARS. Other goals will be to characterize the clinical course of SARS by also evaluating close contacts of people with SARS, as well as those that have recovered from SARS. Additional goals of the protocol are to elucidate the pathophysiology of SARS, characterize the immune response during SARS, and evaluate diagnostic tests for the rapid identification of SARS in clinical specimens. Further knowledge about SARS may lead to effective forms of therapy and improve mortality from this disease.	0

423	This is an efficacy and safety study of desloratadine (MK-4117) in Japanese participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). The primary hypothesis of this study is that the change from Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) is improved by desloratadine compared to placebo.	0
727	As addiction treatment becomes increasingly integrated into the medical care system, two models have rightly received a great deal of attention. The first is the use of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) models to identify cases, provide therapeutic contact, and refer the more severe cases to longer-term care. The second is the treatment of addictions using medical models of treatment, including those that can be implemented in primary care settings. Much less attention has been paid to optimizing strategies for bridging the gap between SBIRT and more intensive/longer-term treatment for those on the severe end of the spectrum. This factor is of critical importance for opioid dependent patients, whose needs are not met by brief interventions or brief treatment. Emergency room interventions for substance use disorders have been largely limited to brief interventions/SBIRT models, and these have focused primarily on alcohol. Although there is a substantial literature documenting the value of case management in linking drug users to treatment, this approach has not been applied to drug users in the emergency department (ED) setting.  In a sample of opioid dependent patients seen in a medical ED who are not currently engaged in treatment, this study will compare the effects of brief strengths-based case management (SBCM) to the effects of screening, assessment and referral alone. Participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence will be randomly assigned (150 per group) to receive 1) Screening, Assessment and Referral or 2) up to 6 sessions of SBCM based on the model previously implemented by Rapp and colleagues in prior studies. Staff who are blinded to treatment condition will complete follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. Aims of the study are to identify the main effects of SBCM on substance abuse treatment initiation and engagement, use of opioids and other drugs, and broader measures of health and life functioning; to examine the interactions between treatment assignment and selected participant attributes in predicting treatment initiation, engagement, and substance use outcomes; and to examine effects of treatment involvement on substance use outcomes in the two treatment groups.  The proposed study will be the first trial using a case management approach to link drug dependent patients presenting in EDs to longer-term addiction treatment. It will be one of the first trials focusing specifically on opioid dependent patients in medical EDs. A further innovative feature is that the case management approach will emphasize linkage to pharmacotherapy, facilitating linkage to office-based buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone for patients who desire this treatment.	0

240	Family doctors can play a critical role in successfully arranging cancer screening tests to occur, especially if they know which patients are due for these tests. However, they don't always interact with or take advantage of registry data to this end. For example, in Ontario, the Screening Activity Report provides exactly this information to family doctors, helping them identify their patients who are overdue for screening. Unfortunately, less than half of family doctors regularly use the Screening Activity Report even though they get monthly email reminders. One possible reason is that the reminders they receive are not designed to compel action. They are easy for family doctors to miss or dismiss. This study will compare multiple different ways of designing the reminders. The different versions of the email are tested in a 2^3 factorial trial testing three behaviour change techniques to see which ones will lead to more family physicians interacting with the Screening Activity Report and at increasing the number of patients that get all the appropriate screening tests for cervical, breast, and/or colon cancer.	0

324	Infectious disease is the single biggest cause of death worldwide. New infectious agents, such as the SARS, MERS and other novel coronavirus, novel influenza viruses, viruses causing viral haemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola), and viruses that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as TBEV & Nipah require investigation to understand pathogen biology and pathogenesis in the host. Even for known infections, resistance to antimicrobial therapies is widespread, and treatments to control potentially deleterious host responses are lacking.  In order to develop a mechanistic understanding of disease processes, such that risk factors for severe illness can be identified and treatments can be developed, it is necessary to understand pathogen characteristics associated with virulence, the replication dynamics and in-host evolution of the pathogen, the dynamics of the host response, the pharmacology of antimicrobial or host-directed therapies, the transmission dynamics, and factors underlying individual susceptibility.  The work proposed here may require sampling that will not immediately benefit the participants. It may also require analysis of the host genome, which may reveal other information about disease susceptibility or other aspects of health status.	0
657	The duration of the study for a patient includes a period for inclusion of up to 3 weeks. The patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal, followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up after the last study treatment administration.  In case of discontinuation of study treatment, the patient will be considered as withdrawn from study treatment, and will be followed as planned for at least 30 days after the last administration of study treatment for safety purpose. In case of study treatment discontinuation without disease progression, efficacy data will be collected every 6 weeks until disease progression, death or end of study whatever comes first. After disease progression, the patient will be followed-up every 12 weeks (3 months) for overall survival until death or end of study.  The patients who benefit from the study treatment can continue until disease progression, toxicity or willingness to stop.	0

740	Screening is an important way to prevent cancer-related death, but many Ontarians do not receive guideline-recommended screening for cervical, breast, and colon cancer. Family physicians can play a critical role in successfully increasing screening rates. A recent evaluation by members of our team suggests that Screening Activity Report (SAR) use is associated with improved cancer screening, but there remains substantial room for improvement. For the SAR to reach its full potential to decrease cancer-related death by improving screening rates, family physicians must regularly access it and take the appropriate actions. Currently, family physicians receive monthly email reminders, which state that new data are available, but do not describe the benefits of the SAR for physicians or their patients. It is easy to imagine how a busy doctor would fail to act upon such emails, resulting in suboptimal use of the SAR and leading to avoidable delays in cancer screening, and management. Indeed, CCO data show that less than half of recipients attend to this email and <7% click through to the SAR. The objectives for this trial are to compare different versions of the reminders in a randomized trial to identify the features that most increase use of the SAR. This is a pragmatic, 2^3 factorial trial, comparing behaviour change techniques incorporated within email reminders to doctors increase their use of the SAR. Participants are those who are already sent monthly emails by CCO regarding the SAR. The trial will randomly assign participants to one of eight modified emails to determine which content is most effective at driving SAR-use over 4 months. With an expected sample size of over 5700 family physicians, we anticipate power to see differences of 3% across experimental conditions.	0

55	Currently, the growing epidemic of a new coronavirus infectious disease (Covid-19) is wreaking havoc worldwide, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with Stem Cell Educator therapy.	0

642	The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is a new and recognized infectious disease of the respiratory tract that is now spreading to several countries in the world, including Brazil. Mortality rates after infection are higher in adults over 60 and with a history of comorbidities. The most serious patients need care in intensive care units (ICU). Most of the time they depend on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infection rates are higher than the capacity for intensive care, which represents a serious problem in medical care. Around 20% of those infected have severe pneumonia and so far it does not have a specific therapy, or even, an effective clinical management. Therapeutic options using malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo test. A recent, small, non-randomized study with hydroxychloroquine in 36 patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 proved to be promising in the ability to reset the viral load in 6 days after starting treatment. Thus, the present study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin compared to hydroxychloroquine monotherapy in the clinical evolution by the ordinal scale of 7 points in adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia caused by infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus in Brazil.	0

949	"In December 2019, a series of unexplained cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan in China has come to light. In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (first named 2019-nCoV, then SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan in early 2020 and soon beyond. On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic.  In humans, an infection with the virus can cause respiratory infections and even very severe pneumonia, which often ends fatally, especially in old and previously ill patients. Due to the novelty of the virus, the data basis for therapy is very limited. To date, there are no clinical data for an effective specific therapy, nor is there a vaccination against the virus available, so that therapy, especially intensive care treatment for very severe cases, must concentrate only on supportive treatment of lung failure and other complications.  The virus is very contagious and infection results in a relevant number of deaths. Due to very uncertain data on the spread of the virus in the population, it is difficult to estimate the mortality rate - case mortality is about 4% based on known case numbers.  In reports on the treatment of the first cases in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) in January 2020, the need for intensive care treatment is described for about a quarter of the inpatient cases, 10-17% had to be ventilated invasively, and venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was necessary in 2-4% of the inpatient cases. Patients requiring ECMO have an extremely high mortality rate of 83-100% in the studies described so far.  In severe cases a pronounced release of vasoactive cytokines was repeatedly observed. Excessive release of these vasoactive mediators (""cytokine storm"") can result in pronounced vasodilatation and membrane leakage, which can ultimately lead to severe vasoplegic shock that is difficult to control. Ruan et al. and Zhou et al. have identified high interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels as a potential predictor of a fatal outcome when compared between survivors and patients who died of COVID-19 disease.  IL-6 is also an important factor in the pathophysiology of severe septic shock and excessive immune response in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) - for both indications has been shown, that the extracorporeal adsorption of IL-6 and other vasoactive substances in a CytoSorb® adsorber (CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) leads to a significant reduction of these cytokines in the patient blood. Clinical experience and (previously unpublished) data from our monocentric registry study show that cytokine adsorption in a CytoSorb® Adsorber can also be safely integrated into a vv-ECMO system.  The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption on humoral inflammation parameters and patient survival under controlled conditions in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."	0

219	Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.  The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147 may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.	0

420	A new human coronavirus that is transmitted through respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China in December 2019 and has spread rapidly. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from isolated attacks on the upper respiratory tract to acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious straightaway or may develop in two stages, with a worsening condition 7 to 10 days after the initial clinical signs, potentially linked to a cytokine storm in the immune system and accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is understood to be between 3% and 4%, with the more severe forms being more frequent among older age groups. Treatment is largely symptomatic as no antiviral treatment to date has shown to be of clinical benefit to this illness. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine, which is commonly used to treat some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is active in vitro in cell models of infection by multiple viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C and SARS-CoV. However, its use in viral infections among humans has not been demonstrated.  Very recently, a non-controlled preliminary study looked into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine on the viral excretion of subjects affected by COVID-19. Among 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in doses of 600 mg per day, the percentage of viral findings of positive SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx using RT-PCR went from 100% on inclusion (start of treatment) to 43% six days later. In comparison, among the 16 patients who were not treated, 90% had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically prevent or limit secondary complications.  The research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and reduces the risk of death or using an invasive artificial ventilator on patients suffering from COVID-19.	0

Specific objectives related to influenza virus infection are to estimate the percentage of participants who go on to develop severe disease or complications that require hospitalization; to obtain information on risk factors for disease severity; and to establish a central repository of specimens for use in virus characterization, including subtyping, antigenic and genetic analyses, identification of signature mutations associated with antiviral drug resistance, mutational evolution, and additional reassortment.  Specific objectives related to novel non-influenza respiratory viruses of potential major public health importance are to characterize initial cases and their outcomes in order to develop more specific protocols that could inform the prevention and treatment of these new infections.  The information used from this study on participants with influenza and novel respiratory virus infections will be rapidly analyzed and shared broadly in order to guide policymakers and to design future studies.  Approximately 500 patients with influenza will be enrolled each year at an estimated 75 sites which are in geographically diverse locations across several continents.  Study Plan:  Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at participating clinical sites. Patients with a diagnosis of influenza (confirmed or suspected), who are hospitalized with complications or severe disease, will be enrolled. At enrollment, consent is signed and information (demographics, medical history (including prior influenza and pneumococcal vaccination), medications (including antivirals) and treatments prescribed) will be recorded. A blood sample for serum and plasma will be obtained at enrollment, as well as an upper respiratory tract sample and lower respiratory tract sample, if appropriate. The respiratory specimens will be sent for central reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for influenza. For participants who are still hospitalized, and not intubated, 5 to 7 days after enrollment an additional upper respiratory sample is obtained. Status will be re-assessed at approximately 28 days and 60 days after enrollment and another blood sample for serum and plasma will obtained at both time points. For participants who are mechanically ventilated additional upper and lower respiratory tract specimens will be obtained at specific timepoints.  In February 2012, the FLU 004 Genomics protocol v 1.0 was released to the field. In August 2013, v 2.0 of the protocol was released as INSIGHT Genomics. The protocol was expanded beyond the FLU 002 and FLU 003 studies to include all qualifying INSIGHT studies (list of qualifying studies is posted on the INSIGHT website, www.insight-trials.org). The purpose of this substudy is to obtain a whole blood sample from which DNA will be extracted to study polymorphisms in immune response genes and other genetic variants that may be associated with an increased risk of severe influenza.  Participating FLU 003 Plus sites are given the option to also participate in INSIGHT Genomics which requires a separate protocol registration. Participants, once consented to FLU 003 Plus, will be offered the option to also consent to INSIGHT Genomics which includes a single whole blood sample collection. Participation in FLU 003 Plus will not be compromised if a participant opts not to participate in INSIGHT Genomics.	0

811	Phase 3 clinical trial will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices and is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the safety and efficacy of STAHIST (IMP) in 300 adult and adolescent subjects 12-60 years of age, of either sex or any race with a minimum 2-year history of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and a baseline minimum total symptom score (TSS) of not less than 8 on the S5 Subject Diary. Subjects will be treated twice daily with IMP or placebo for a period of two weeks. Subjects will visit the study site for at least 4 visits: screening, randomization/study inception, end-of-week one, final visit, and unscheduled visits as appropriate.  Run In (washout period): Subjects will be required to stop using oral nasal decongestants or first generation antihistamines for 48 hours, second generation antihistamines and Singulair for seven days, systemic corticosteroids for 30 days, and nasal or ocular corticosteroid medications for two weeks. Use of these drugs will also not be allowed during the study.  The first dose will be administered at the study site and subjects will be monitored on-site for one hour following dosing. There will be 24-hour on-call telephone access between physician/office staff and study subjects.  A Study Flow Chart will be used to facilitate trial management, record completed tasks as well as document their time of completion (See Study Flow Chart and Source Documents—Appendix D).  Safety evaluations will include monitoring of subject-reported AEs, measurement of vital signs, and assessment of safety laboratory data. Qualified independent, non-study administration individuals will be selected prior to the start of treatment for the purpose of safety monitoring.  300 subjects will be randomized. Assuming a screen failure test rate of approximately 33%, approximately 450 subjects will be screened.  At the conclusion of the study, the CSR will be prepared by the Sponsor, reviewed and approved by the Principal/Coordinator Investigator before submission.	0

910	To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.  In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progress to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbility and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.  In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected eukaryotic cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of COVID-19 related disease, when administered at an early stage.	0

871	The study will evaluate the role of antiviral therapy in COPD. Previous research has demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is more frequently identified in the airways of COPD sufferers when compared to unaffected smokers. It is not known whether suppression of EBV helps in COPD.  Hypothesis. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with valaciclovir is safe and will suppress Epstein-Barr virus in the sputum of patients with COPD.  Trial objectives. To conduct a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial of Epstein-Barr virus suppression in COPD.  To evaluate the safety of valaciclovir (1 gram three times daily for 8 weeks) for the suppression of Epstein-Barr virus in COPD.  To study the biological effects of EBV suppression on airway and blood markers of inflammation in COPD.  The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to evaluate if a long established antiviral therapy (valaciclovir), routinely used to treat herpes zoster virus infection, can be used to suppress EBV shedding within the airways of COPD sufferers compared to placebo. The treatment will be randomised and blinded to both patients and investigators. The trial will recruit 88 participants who will undergo lung function testing, clinical assessment and provide blood and sputum samples at three separate hospital visits during an 8-week period (samples will be collected at 0, 4 & 8 weeks). A small subgroup of trial participants will undergo bronchoscopy on a voluntary basis to enable assessment of the airway cells before and after treatment. The study will take place in The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Patients who suffer from COPD (GOLD 2 & GOLD 3) and concurrent EBV infection will be eligible to participate in the study. If the treatment is effective this will lead to further research to determine whether antiviral therapy is effective in patients with COPD. The study will also provide new information about the mechanisms of how COPD develops and potentially identify new therapeutic targets.  Data management. The Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU) will be responsible for data management during the conduct of the trial. Following electronic CRF submission data will be processed by NICTU as per CTU SOPs. All data will be anonymised. Data queries will be generated by site staff as required to clarify data or request missing information.  Data storage. All data and trial records will be stored by the CI in accordance with current regulatory requirements.  Sample size. A sample size of 31 subjects per group will have a 90% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 to detect a difference in the exploratory efficacy outcome (EBV quantitative PCR).  Statistical analysis. Analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis and all statistical tests will be at the 2-sided p-value of 0.05. Comparison between groups for the primary outcome measure SARs will be made using Fisher's exact test.  The exploratory efficacy outcome EBV shedding will initially be analyzed by chi-square test followed by logistic regression with adjustment for covariates if required. The comparison of continuous secondary/exploratory outcomes will be initially by t-tests followed by analysis of covariance if adjustment for covariates is required. Statistical diagnostic methods will be used to check for violations of the assumptions, and transformations will be performed where required.  Correlations between changes in the biological markers measured and physiological and clinical outcomes will be assessed by appropriate graphical and statistical methods including Pearson's (or Spearman's) correlation coefficient.  A single final analysis is planned at the end of the trial.  A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written before the statistical analysis commences.	0

155	In December 2019, a pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, in China. In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has dramatically increased, with almost 150'000 cases and more than 6'000 reported deaths on March, 16th 2020.  Little is known on the rate of human-to-human transmission of this new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the community and within the hospital.  Depending on the country, contact subjects considered to be at high or moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 are, either isolated at home for a period of time defined by the health authorities or, on the contrary, continue their professional activity on the condition that they adopt measures to prevent transmission to those around them. In most European countries, healthcare workers adopt this second option. In all cases, it is most often recommended that contact persons monitor their state of health and communicate it to the persons dedicated to this action.  Whether such subjects become spreaders of the virus is not known, nor is the proportion of viral spreader who will develop a symptomatic infection.  In this study, we aim to evaluate the virological and clinical outcomes of subjects following a contact at high/moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, in community-subjects and/or healthcare workers.  The study population is represented by all subjects who had a contact with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and whose contact was considered to be at high/moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition.  This include both children and adult subjects, subject without social security, and healthcare workers.

196	The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of XL765 in combination with Temozolomide in adults with anaplastic gliomas or glioblastoma on a stable Temozolomide maintenance dose. XL765 is a new chemical entity that inhibits the kinases PI3K and mTOR. In preclinical studies, inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells, whereas inactivation of mTOR has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar®) is an orally administered alkylating agent with activity against malignant gliomas. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the following indications: 1) treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients when given concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment; 2) refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), ie, patients who have experienced disease progression on a drug regimen containing nitrosourea and procarbazine. Temozolomide is commonly used in the treatment of other anaplastic gliomas (AG) including oligodendroglial tumors and mixed gliomas.	0

562	Beginning in February 2003, there was an outbreak with a novel coronavirus causing an atypical pneumonia, subsequently referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate and has no proven treatment. There is, however, some evidence that treatment with convalescent plasma was beneficial.  The primary purpose of this protocol is to collect plasma by apheresis from patients that recovered from SARS, and process this plasma into a high titer anti-SARS intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). This will be a collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Cangene Corporation has been contracted to manufacture the collected plasma in the United States (U.S.) into an IVIG product, which can then be used for pre-clinical efficacy studies under an IND in a clinical trial if SARS recurs. It is intended that the treatment trial would be conducted in Hong Kong and/or the U.S., as well as any other place the disease recurs.	0

144	COVID-19 infection is overwhelming Italian healthcare. There is an urgent need for a solution to the lack of ICU beds and increasing deaths day after day.  A recent retrospective Chinese paper (JAMA Intern Med, online March 13, 2020) showed impressive positive effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on survival of SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients. We're routinely using MP for severe pneumonia-ARDS with acute respiratory failure with very good results.  The main objective of this multi-centre observational trial is to evaluate the efficacy of low dose prolonged infusion of methylprednisolone (MP) for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.	0
