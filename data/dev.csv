685	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. More than half of lung cancer patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, with a median survival of only 10-12 months. In recent years the development of more efficacious therapies for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based upon an improved understanding of the underlying tumor biology has resulted in an improvement in median overall survival by several months. However, survival remains poor for most patients and there remains an urgent unmet need for novel treatment strategies to improve survival for these patients.  Avelumab is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. In phase I studies, avelumab was well-tolerated at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV Q2 weeks with the most frequently observed treatment related adverse events including fatigue, infusion-related reactions, nausea, chills, diarrhea, and pyrexia. However, many patients will not respond to checkpoint inhibition, and developing strategies to further improve the efficacy and extend the benefit of these treatments to non-responding and progressing patients is an area of substantial need. Among NSCLC patients, approximately 80% of patients will not respond to a checkpoint inhibitor as monotherapy.  Combinatorial strategies may increase response rates. Radiotherapy is an intriguing partner therapy, with preclinical and clinical studies confirming the immunomodulatory effects of radiotherapy. There is particularly interest in the use of radiotherapy in patients who have failed a checkpoint inhibitor as monotherapy as this approach will isolate the effects of radiation in enhancing response rates.  Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR) (also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy or SBRT) has emerged as a potentially curative treatment option for patients with early stage, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer and as a safe and effective local treatment for metastatic lesions.  The investigators hypothesize that local radiotherapy can augment the systemic effects of avelumab in NSCLC patients previously refractory to a checkpoint inhibitor previously used as standard-of-care treatment. This proposal seeks to gain insight into the clinical and biological efficacy of this combination.	0

808	The new coronavirus (COVID-19) [1] belongs to the new beta coronavirus. Current research shows that it has 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45), but its genetic characteristics are similar to SARSr-CoV. There is a clear difference from MERSr-COV. Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a new type of coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, as of 12:00 on February 12, 2020, a total of 44726 confirmed cases nationwide (Hubei Province) 33,366 cases, accounting for 74.6%), with 1,114 deaths (1068 cases in Hubei Province), and a mortality rate of 2.49% (3.20% in Hubei Province).  In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current treatment. Xiyanping injection has anti-inflammatory and immune regulation effects. In the early clinical practice of treating severe H1N1, it was clinically concerned, and combined with conventional treatment, and achieved good results.	0
102	Primary Objective:  - to assess the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate in the breast of patients treated in following combinations: SAR240550 twice-weekly + weekly paclitaxel, SAR240550 weekly+ weekly paclitaxel, and weekly paclitaxel single agent as calibrator.  Secondary objectives are:  pCR rate in the breast and axilla, Radiological/clinical objective response rate (ORR), breast conservation rate, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), in each treatment arm, Safety profiles of study combinations and of the single agent reference treatment, Molecular characteristics of the tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and any correlation between the biological activity of the study treatment and the disease outcome.  Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.	0

761	This study aim to evaluate the immune response of negative patients during a COVID-19 outbreak in patients with no symptoms and with no known exposure to the COVID-19.  Patients are tested with a VivaDiag ™ COVID-19 lgM / IgG Rapid Test at day 0, day 7 and day 14. The investigators expect test to be negative on all the measurements in those patients that do not develop symptoms and that continue to have no known history of exposure to COVID-19  Patients that develop symptoms (cough, fever or respiratory distress) and a possible contact with people positive for COVID-19 OR patients that show a positive VivaDiag test during the time frame of the test are asked to attend the COVID-19 RT - PCR &CT.  Subsequently, the investigators will continue, repeating two tests seven days apart every 30 days (predefined times 0-7-14, then 30-37, 60-67) for the next six months. The investigators can evaluate to stop the test however before the six months if there are no new cases of COVID-19 for at least 21 days in the region where the enrolled patients live.  The test in use is the VivaDiag ™ COVID-19 lgM / IgG  Procedure (as per the protocol in use for the administration of the test)  take out the test kit and leave it at least 30 minutes in the room where the test will be performed. place the test equipment on a clean and dust-free surface First insert 10µL of whole blood or serum or plasma in the area reserved for blood (in the well) present on the test, then apply 2 drops of buffer. read the result after 15 minutes  Interpretation of test results  Positive result  The anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgM band are both colored and the lgG band does not stain. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is positive. The anti-COVID-19 lgG antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgG band are both colored and the lgM band does not stain. This means that the COVID-19 lgG antibody is positive. The lgG and lgM anti-COVID-19 antibodies are detected if: the C band, the lgG band and the lgM band are all three colored. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are both positive.  Negative result The anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are not detected if only the quality control C band is stained but the lgG and lgM bands are not colored, this means that the test is negative.  Invalid result  If the quality control band C does not color, regardless of whether the lgG and lgM bands are colored or not, the result is invalid and the test must be started again.

990	At present, the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Wuhan and Hubei provinces has attracted great attention from the medical community across the country. Both 2019-nCoV and SARS viruses are coronaviruses, and they have a large homology.  Published laboratory studies have suggested that SARS virus infection and its lung injury are related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lung tissue. And ACE and ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are vital central links to maintain hemodynamic stability and normal heart and kidney function in vivo.  A large amount of evidence-based medical evidence shows that ACE inhibitors are the basic therapeutic drugs for maintaining hypertension, reducing the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal adverse events, improving quality of life, and prolonging life in patients with hypertension. Recent experimental studies suggest that treatment with ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce pulmonary inflammation and cytokine release caused by coronavirus infection.	0

309	This study is a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of treatments for COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. The study is a multi-centre/country trial that will be conducted in various sites in Europe with Inserm as sponsor. Adults (≥18 year-old) hospitalized for COVID-19 with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air OR acute respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support will be randomized between 4 treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care (SoC) in the participating hospital: SoC alone versus SoC + Remdesivir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon ß-1a versus SoC + Hydroxychloroquine. Randomization will be stratified by European region and severity of illness at enrollment (moderate disease: patients NOT requiring non-invasive ventilation NOR high flow oxygen devices NOR invasive mechanical ventilation NOR ECMO and severe disease: patients requiring non-invasive ventilation OR high flow oxygen devices OR invasive mechanical ventilation OR ECMO). The interim trial results will be monitored by a Data Monitoring Committee, and if at any stage evidence emerges that any one treatment arm is definitely inferior then it will be centrally decided that that arm will be discontinued. Conversely, if good evidence emerges while the trial is continuing that some other treatment(s) should also be being evaluated then it will be centrally decided that one or more extra arms will be added while the trial is in progress. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the primary endpoint is the subject clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15.	0

535	Beaumont Quantitative CT lung function imaging (BQLFI) uses mathematical modeling to determine regional differences in ventilation (CT-V) and pulmonary blood mass (PBM) from a pair of inspiration-expiration CT scans or time-resolved four-dimensional (4D) CT scans. CT-V and PBM images provide surrogates for pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, respectively, in the form of detailed functional maps. CT-V and PBM therefore allow us to distinguish healthy from abnormal lung. Moreover, the technique generalizes to recover lung compliance imaging (LCI) when the CT is acquired at different pressure settings, in order to characterize lung stiffness. PBM and CT-V can detect parenchymal lung function changes at a voxel level and can be used to 1) assess disease progression in SARS-CoV-2, 2) detect treatment effects, and 3) identify early changes in high-risk patients prior to their development of disease. BQLFI affords the opportunity to provide imaging biomarkers that enable the early diagnosis of lung injury, which in turn cause impairment in gas exchange at the level of alveolar capillary interface. Currently, there are no available imaging biomarkers to predict patients at risk of progression or identify those at risk of developing severe disease with SARS-CoV-2. Our proposed study will validate a novel methodology, based on state-of-the-art CT-V and PBM imaging that can accurately measure regional ventilation and perfusion, as a means for improving surveillance, diagnosis, and prognostication of patients with SARS-CoV-2. This is a prospective, pilot study of 25 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2, who have mild to moderate disease, defined as positive PCR screen and not requiring invasive mechanical ventilator support or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula. Participants will provide informed consent and eligibility will be confirmed. Demographics and medical history will be obtained. Participants will undergo one inspiration-expiration CT. Outcomes and adverse events will be assessed over 30 day using chart review or phone interview.	0

140	Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strain is associated with severe morbidity and mortality estimated today from 2% to 4%. Elderly patients or patients with serious chronic conditions justifying hospitalization are particularly at risk. The risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization is also substantial and increased in fragile patients. Several cases of infection among Healthcare Professionals had been reported.  The hypothesis is that similar to the corona virus agent responsible for SRAS and the influenza virus, nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 to be feared. Health care professionals and caregivers are populations-at-risk as they are exposed in the community and can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalized patients, and are also exposed to hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.  Describing hospital-acquired cases and SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission chains in healthcare settings is vitally essential to achieve control of this epidemic. To improve the quality of care and patient safety, this data must be accompanied by an analysis of the impact of infection control measures. In addition, an effective infection control program is urgently required to control the spread of the virus and protect both uninfected patients who require care for other medical or surgical conditions as well as health care professionals.  The main objective of this prospective, non-interventional - observational, hospital based study in adults and children is to describe and document suspected or confirmed cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk factors/protective factors) at participating hospitals.  Characterization of the clinical features of the SARS-CoV-2 infection will help to identify potential sources of virus transmission as rapidly as possible and enable implementation of appropriate hygiene practices in hospitals.	0

462	There is now a global epidemic of diabetes and obesity affecting more than 300 million people worldwide with Asia in the forefront. In Hong Kong, diabetes affects more than 10% of the population. Patients with diabetes have a 12—25% lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer.The abnormal metabolic milieus of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, pro-thrombotic state and chronic inflammation in diabetes causes atherosclerosis.A significant proportion of subjects have underlying peripheral arterial disease and neuropathy. These subjects are at great risk of developing infective foot ulceration secondary to impaired vascular supply, sensory loss and minor trauma.Without prompt and proper medical treatment, these infective ulcers will deteriorate leading to gangrene and limb amputation. In-vitro and in-vivo studies revealed that 5 out of the 12 herbs were effective in promoting fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis. To minimize potential drug interactions and adverse effects from multiple components in a recipe of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the investigators have developed a simplified formula from the 12 herbs consisting of only two herbs. In this proof-of-concept study, the investigators hypothesize that the novel recipe of herbal medicine will expedite healing of early foot ulcer by promoting vascularisation and granulation as well as modulating inflammatory response.	0

872	This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with 2 study groups (vaccine and placebo). Three doses of the study vaccine are given according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule. Vaccine efficacy will be assessed by maintaining active surveillance for clinical hepatitis every 2 weeks and hospital based surveillance for the full duration of the trial. Total planned study population is 2000 eligible subjects (1000 in the vaccine group and 1000 in the placebo group). Total vaccinated cohort for the analysis of reactogenicity is 200 (100 in the vaccine group and 100 in the placebo group).  Volunteers who enroll will be followed for evidence of symptomatic liver disease for approximately 2 years, and those who become ill will be admitted to hospital for care.  To evaluate safety, a randomly designated subset will be monitored for 7 days after each vaccination to solicit specific symptoms at the injection site and generally. Additionally, all adverse events will be collected for 30 days after each vaccine dose and all serious adverse events will be collected throughout the trial.	0

375	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infectious disease characterized by acute respiratory impairment due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).	0

639	Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides accurate and reproducible measures of cardiac chamber volumes, cardiac function, blood flow, myocardial scar, myocardial extracellular volume as a measure of collagen content, myocardial iron content, and others, all without exposure to ionizing radiation. The prevailing wisdom is that CMR using high specific absorption rate (SAR) scanning modes produces highest image quality. We propose a method of CMR that can be performed with low SAR but that nevertheless preserves image quality because of efficient use of CMR signal. CMR using low SAR is attractive because it may reduce heating of metallic structures. This may allow safe CMR in patients with metallic implants, and it may allow MRI catheterization using metallic guidewires and catheter devices.  The goal of this non-significant risk (NSR) medical device study is to test initial technical feasibility of low SAR CMR in healthy volunteers by technical optimization of scanner protocols, to test comparative accuracy of standard CMR measurements in healthy volunteers using low SAR CMR versus conventional CMR.  A secondary goal is to assess the potential of this new low-SAR MRI system to perform cardiovascular diagnostic imaging and non-cardiovascular radiological diagnostic imaging by testing comparative diagnostic accuracy of standard MR measurements in adult patients with known disease using the low SAR CMR system vs conventional MR exam.	0

881	This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 75 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. The initial sample size is calculated to be approximately 440 subjects, and if any additional therapeutic arms are added, the sample size will be recalculated. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm as assessed by clinical severity, hospitalization, and mortality, and 2) evaluate the safety of different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm.	0

368	The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and generate pharmacokinetic profiles of BSI-201 after IV administration in adult subjects with histologically documented advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available. Additionally, the safety and tolerability and clinical response of BSI-201 + irinotecan will be investigated in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the phase 1b portion of the study.  Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.	0

331	Atherosclerosis in the setting of HIV infection is distinct and includes increased vascular inflammation, worsened endothelial function, and a predominance of non-calcified plaque. These outcomes can be assessed using specialized noninvasive imaging which strongly predict future CV events in the general population.  PCSK9 has emerged as an important pharmacologic target for cholesterol lowering in the general population and recent studies among individuals without HIV have shown that PCSK9 inhibitor therapy is safely tolerated and significantly reduces major CV events in the general population.  The investigators will perform a clinical trial of PCSK9 inhibition in the setting of HIV infection. This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on vascular inflammation, endothelial function, and non-calcified plaque using a PCSK9 inhibitor called alirocumab. This study will recruit 140 treated individuals with HIV who are aged 40 and older, with known CVD or risk factors for CVD and who have evidence of vascular inflammation at baseline.  The primary and secondary objective of this study is to determine whether PCSK9 inhibition can improve arterial inflammation as assessed by FDG-PET/CT and endothelial function as assessed by flow mediated vasodilation. The investigators will correlate changes in arterial inflammation and endothelial function with lipids and markers of inflammation and immune activation.  The tertiary objective is to perform a pilot evaluation of the impact of PCSK9 inhibition on non-calcified plaque as measured by coronary CT angiography. Non-calcified plaque measurements will be correlated with changes in lipid parameters and markers of inflammation and immune activation.	0
201	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease. Its pathogen is a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The clinical course can be classified to 3 stages: viral replication phase, hyperimmune reactive phase, and pulmonary destruction phase. Human monocyte plays a critical role in the initiation of immune response in defending the intracellular pathogens (eg viruses). Monocytes can engulf viruses and present the viral antigens in the major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule to the cell surface to initiate T lymphocyte response. Monocytes also secrete various cytokines to modulate immune response. SARS-CoV is a mutant of animal virus to cause human disease and is able to cause unusual severe respiratory illness. It is suggested the unusual severe disease is due to the intense immune reaction.  The investigators will harvest human monocytes from healthy adult and children blood donors. Monocytes would be cultured and infected by SARS-CoV. The change of viral load is monitored after infection. Cytokines secreted by monocytes after infection are also measured. The difference of monocyte cytokine secretion is compared between adults and children. The study is to verify the SARS-CoV infectivity of human monocytes and prove the unusual severity caused by SARS-CoV is related to viral-induced dysregulation of cytokine responses. The results may also clarify why adults tend to have a more severe illness compared with children.	0
283	The ways in which influenza is transmitted between people are uncertain; for example, we do not know if large droplets or fine particles (aerosols) matter most; both are produced by coughing and sneezing. This means we cannot say what precautions work best in real life. Improving our understanding is vital to allow the development of guidelines and policies to help reduce the transmission of both pandemic and seasonal flu.  The aim of this study is to explore how influenza is spread, specifically by looking at the importance of spread via small particles (aerosols/droplet nuclei) that are carried in respiratory sprays e.g. produced by coughing and sneezing.  The primary objective of this study is:  To estimate the contribution of aerosols/droplet nuclei to influenza transmission by determining the secondary attack rate (SAR) of influenza in Recipients randomised to a control arm (no intervention - allowing all modes of transmission) compared to Recipients randomised to an intervention arm (face shield and hand hygiene - allowing only transmission by aerosols/droplet nuclei) when both groups of Recipients are exposed to Donor volunteers infected with influenza via intranasal drops.  The hypothesis is that:  The SAR will be lower in Recipients exposed only to aerosols/droplet nuclei (intervention arm) compared to those exposed to all modes of transmission (the control arm): aerosols/droplet nuclei, droplet spray (larger respiratory droplets) and transmission through contact.	0
898	We plan to carry out an experimental study enrolling more than 2000 medical staff and divide them into low-risk group and high-risk group according to whether they directly exposed to 2019-nCOV infected patients.

921	"Heyland et al. previously proposed a novel scoring tool, the Nutrition Risk in Critically ill (NUTRIC) score, which is the first nutritional risk assessment tool developed and validated specifically for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Many other risk scores and assessment tools exist to quantify nutrition risk but none have been specifically designed for ICU patients. Indeed, they generally consider all critically ill patients to be at high nutritional risk. However, the recognition that not all ICU patients will respond the same to nutritional interventions was the critical concept behind the NUTRIC score. There was an interaction between mortality, nutritional intake and NUTRIC score suggesting that those with higher NUTRIC scores benefited the most from increasing nutritional intake. However, the inferences about the validity of the NUTRIC score are limited in Chinese patients because of no data.  The current outbreak of novel coronavirus was first reported from Wuhan, China on Dec ember 31 , 2019 . This virus was named as 2019 nCoV by World Health Organization ( on Jan uary 12 , 2020). Following the advice of the Emergency Committee, the WHO declared the outbreak of 2019 nCoV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern . Patients show fever and / or respiratory symptoms, with the imaging characteristics of pneumonia, and other symptoms include hemoptysis muscle pain, headache, confusion, chest pain, and diarrhea. About 16% patients need ICU admission.  The objective of this study is to validation of the ""NUTRIC"" nutritional risk assessment tool in Chinese ICU patients diagnosed as COVID-19. This is a single-center, prospective cohort study of ICU patients with COVID-19. Data for all variables of the NUTRIC score will be collected. These include age, APACHE II score, SOFA score, number of co-morbidities, days from hospital admission to ICU admission. A logistic model including the NUTRIC score, the nutritional adequacy and their interaction will be estimated to assess if the NUTRIC score modified the association between nutritional adequacy and 28-day mortality."	0

918	Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is a severe orphan genetic disease responsible for skin and mucosal detachments due to a loss of adhesion of the epidermis to the underlying dermis. The disease is caused by loss of function mutations of the COL7A1 encoding type VII collagen (C7) which forms anchoring fibers, which are essential structures for dermal-epidermal adherence. Current treatments are only symptomatic and do not effectively treat or prevent the occurrence of cutaneous and mucosal detachments responsible for local and systemic complications that threaten the vital prognosis.  EBGRAFT is a prospective open-label international monocentric phase I/II clinical trial. It aims to treat 3 adult subjects with RDEB, expressing residual C7 levels, by genetically corrected autologous skin equivalent grafts.  The skin equivalent consists of keratinocytes and fibroblasts from the patient, genetically corrected ex vivo with a secure Self INactivating (SIN) retroviral vector expressing the COL7A1 cDNA under the control of the ubiquitous human promoter EF1a.  Each patient will be grafted sequentially at Necker Hospital in Paris using autologous genetically corrected skin equivalents of approximately 300 cm2 (up to 6 grafts of 50 cm2 each).  The main objective is to evaluate the safety of autologous skin equivalent grafts genetically corrected with a SIN COL7A1 retroviral vector (RV) in adults with RDEB.  The secondary objectives are:  To evaluate the efficacy of transplanting autologous skin equivalent genetically corrected with RV SIN COL7A1 in adults with RDEB. To evaluate the immune response against recombinant type VII collagen (C7).  This clinical trial should evaluate whether the grafting of these genetically corrected autologous skin equivalents is well tolerated and whether they restore normal dermal-epidermal adherence of the grafted areas. The proposed treatment aims to obtain a permanent correction of the grafted areas, allowing skin healing and reducing pain. It has the potential to reduce itching, to prevent the occurrence of blisters and skin detachments, reduce the risk of infections, the duration and cost of care and also the risk of development of squamous cell carcinomas in the grafted areas.	0

855	To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.  In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.  In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when administered at an early stage.	0

177	Infection with SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus type 2 was highlighted in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China, responsible for an pandemic evolution since March 11, 2020. The infection affects all ages of life, although affecting children in a very small proportion of cases. The typical presentation of the disease combines fever (98%), cough (76%), myalgia and asthenia (18%) as well as leukopenia (25%) and lymphopenia (63%). Upper airway involvement rare.  The main clinical presentation requiring hospitalization of infected patients is that of atypical pneumonia which may require critical care management (27%), and progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (67%) involving life-threatening conditions in almost 25% of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other organ damage have been reported, mainly concerning kidney damage (29%) which may require renal replacement therapy in approximately 17% of patients.  Neurological damage has been very rarely studied, yet reported in 36% of cases in a study including patients of varying severity.  Finally, the mortality associated with this emerging virus is high in patients for whom critical care management is necessary, reported in 62% of patients.  We therefore propose a prospective observational study which aim at reporting the prevalence of acute encephalopathy at initial management in critical care, to report its morbidity and mortality and to identify prognostic factors.	0

622	2019-new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (COVID-19) is highly contagious and responsible for thousands of casualties. Originated in Wuhan (China), the 2019-nCoV is spreading to many countries, including Italy, Korea and Japan. While no targeted-treatment against 2019-nCoV virus is available to-date, inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown antiviral activity against Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The investigators designed this study to assess whether inhaled NO improves survival in patients affected with severe COVID-2019.  The clinical spectrum of symptomatic patients ranges from mild upper respiratory syndrome to severe diffuse viral pneumonia in the context of severe multiorgan dysfunction leading to death. In China, overall reported fatality rate is between 2.2% in patients with proven infection. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, about 25% required admission to ICU. Of these, 61% of patients met clinical criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In another retrospective study in Wuhan (China) on 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the incidence of patients with pneumonia meeting ARDS criteria was 67%. ICU mortality reached 63%, with various profiles of combined organ failure in deceased patients (81% with ARDS, 37.5% with AKI, 28% with cardiac injury and 28% with liver failure).  In 2004, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, it was demonstrated that treatment with NO reversed pulmonary hypertension, improved severe hypoxia and shortened the length of ventilatory support as compared to matched control patients with SARS-CoV. In a subsequent in-vitro study, NO donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of SARS-CoV-infected eukaryotic cells, suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. Coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV shares most of the genome of COVID-19 indicating potential effectiveness of inhaled NO therapy in these patients.  Here, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial aimed to prevent progression of the disease in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Control group: the institutional standard of care will be delivered. Treatment group: in addition to standard therapy, the subjects will receive inhalation of NO. Inspired NO/N2 will be delivered at 80 parts per million (ppm) in the first 48 hours of enrollment. After that, NO levels will be decreased to 40 ppm until severe hypoxia resolves. Weaning from NO will start when patients improves the level of oxygenation to a PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg or SpO2 > 93% for more than 24 hours consecutively. Physician will follow their own institutional weaning protocols. In the absence of institutional protocols, NO will be reduced every 4 hours in step-wise fashion starting from 40 ppm to 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 ppm. If hypoxemia (SpO2 < 93%) or acute hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) occurs during weaning, NO should be increased to a prior higher concentration.  Safety: prolonged treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increased methemoglobin levels. Blood levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter or MetHb levels in blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the study, inhaled NO concentration will be halved.	0

516	On January 2020, the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was officially announced by the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). This new virus is presented as the causative agent of pneumonias. Its complete genome was sequenced by the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur on 29 January 2020 in France. This will allow the identification of antigenic structures involved in the immune response and the development of serological diagnostic tests.  Many questions are being asked about this new virus and the infection it causes, including questions about the transition from animal to human occur, the beginning of viral circulation in humans, the period of contagiousness, the percentage of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic forms. Serological studies can provide answers to these questions. There is no serological test for SARS-COV-2 yet, but the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur is working on its development.  We propose to carry out a collection of samples taken from subjects who travelled to China before the epidemic outbreak or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.  As soon as it is available, serology will be performed on the collected samples.	0

943	Fat tissue obtainment:  Subjects will undergo liposuction under local anesthesia. In this procedure, Ringer's solution with the anesthetic lidocaine and vasoconstrictor adrenaline infused into the adipose compartment to minimize blood loss and contamination of the tissue by peripheral blood cells. 15 minutes later a hollow blunt-tipped 3 mm cannula introduced into the subcutaneous space through small (0.5 cm) incision. The cannula attached to syringe and under gentle suction moved through the adipose compartment, mechanically disrupting the fat tissue. Aspirate volume - approximately 150-200 cc. Procedure time - 30 minutes.  ADRC isolation:  Aspirated fat tissue placed into sterile vessel which inserted into Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) - closed system for automated and standardized extraction and concentration of ADRC. Celution 800/CRS System drains excess of fluid from fat tissue and estimate it's volume After that lipoaspirate washed extensively with equal volumes of Ringer's solution to remove blood. At the end of this process System indicates required volume of enzyme reagent (Celase®) which should be added immediately by operator.

198	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The major clinical features of SARS include fever, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and a rapid progression of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiologic images. The SARS-related deaths have resulted mainly from pulmonary complications, including progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pathological changes in SARS suggest that SARS sequelae such as infiltration of PMN in lung tissue, multiple organ dysfunction and ARDS have been associated with cytokines and chemokine dysregulation. Some patients still manifested lung injury at a time when the viral load was falling also supports the immune nature of the lung damage. We therefore undertook an analysis of dynamic production of cytokine/chemokines in SARS patients with an initial normal chest radiograph in order to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and improve patient management.	0

299	"COVID-19 Viral Global Pandemic resulting in post-infection pulmonary damage, including Fibrotic Lung Disease due to inflammatory and reactive protein secretions damaging pulmonary alveolar structure and functionality. A short review includes:  Early December, 2019 - A pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office. January 30th, 2020 - The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. February 7th, 2020 - 34-year-old Ophthalmologist who first identified a SARS-like coronavirus) dies from the same virus. February 11th, 2020 - WHO announces a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19. February 19th, 2020 - The U.S. has its first outbreak in a Seattle nursing home which were complicated with loss of lives.. March 11th, 2020 - WHO declares the virus a pandemic and in less than three months, from the time when this virus was first detected, the virus has spread across the entire planet with cases identified in every country including Greenland. March 21st, 2020 - Emerging Infectious Disease estimates the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and ≈1% in other, more mildly affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control."" March 21st 2020 -Much of the United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing abilities ramp up..  March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New York-New Jersey, Washington, and California.  Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started.  The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage and inflammatory changes that accompanied.  This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cellular stromal vascular fraction (cSVF) deployed intravenously to examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual, permanent damaged alveolar tissues of the lungs."	0
204	This study will test whether an experimental vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is safe, causes any side effects, and causes an immune response. SARS affects the respiratory system, usually starting with fever and muscle aches. Patients may get a dry cough and have difficulty breathing. Infection may be mild, but it can lead to death.  Vaccines contain substances from an infectious agent, such as a virus, that, when injected into a person's body, stimulates production of antibodies that create resistance, or immunity, to that agent. The vaccine in this study contains genetic material (DNA) that codes for a protein found in the virus that causes SARS. Injected into a muscle, it instructs the body to make a small amount of a SARS protein. The vaccine is made from just one small part of the code for one SARS protein; a person cannot get SARS from the vaccine.  Normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who are in general good health may be eligible for this 32-week study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests.  Participants have nine clinic visits during the study. They receive three vaccine injections, given with a system called the Bioinjector 2000® (Registered Trademark), which delivers the vaccine through the skin without the use of a needle. Following each injection, participants take home a diary card, on which they record their temperature and any vaccine side effects daily for 5 days. Participants must immediately report any symptoms to a study physician, and, if necessary, go to the clinic for an examination. Participants have the following tests and procedures:  Vaccine injections (study day 0, around week 4, and around week 8, with at least 21 days between injections) Medical history and, if needed, physical examination (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 32) Check of vital signs and weight (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32) Lymph node examination (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) Blood draw (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32) Pregnancy test for women (day 0 and weeks 4, 8 and 32) Urine sample (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)	0

520	SAR 1118 is a potent and selective small molecule lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist and may be therapeutically useful as a novel topical anti-inflammatory agent in a wide variety of ocular inflammatory conditions including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Recent evidence has demonstrated that topically delivered SAR 1118 ophthalmic solution can be detected in the aqueous, vitreous, and retina 4 to 12 hours after dosing at potentially therapeutic levels in animal models. However, the ability for the current sterile ophthalmic formulation of SAR 1118 to penetrate in sufficiently high therapeutic concentrations into the anterior and posterior chamber in humans is unknown.	0

649	This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double dummy study of children with SAR conducted during the Spring tree and grass allergy season. Subjects qualified for randomization if the diary cards included (1) symptom scores of ≥2 for at least 2 of the following 4 rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on 4 or more days: sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes; and (2) a total rhinoconjunctivitis (or Total Symptom Severity Complex [TSSC]) score of ≥5 on any 4 days. The TSSC score was expressed as the sum of the 4 individual symptoms scores recorded in the daily diary cards for the following symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes.  Subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments in a double-blind fashion using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio: cetirizine HCl syrup and placebo loratadine syrup; loratadine syrup and placebo cetirizine HCl syrup; or cetirizine placebo syrup and loratadine placebo syrup.  Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): 1100 planned; 1536 screened; 683 randomized: 231 (33.8%) randomized to the cetirizine HCl treatment group, 221 (32.4%) to the loratadine treatment group, and 231 (33.8%) to the placebo treatment group.  Test Product and Reference Therapy: Subjects randomized to receive cetirizine HCl syrup also received placebo syrup; subjects randomized to receive loratadine syrup also received placebo syrup; and both placebo syrups were received by subjects randomized to receive placebo.  Duration of Double-Blind Treatment: 2 weeks.  Safety measures included the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), vital signs, concomitant medications, and physical examination findings. Clinical laboratory evaluation was not required for this study.  Statistical Methods: All statistical tests related to treatment effect were 2-sided, and statistical significance was declared at the 0.05 probability level. Least squares means (LSMeans) were used to estimate treatment effect. Populations analyzed included the Full Analysis (intent-to-treat [ITT]) Set (FAS), Per-Protocol Set (PPS), Safety-Analyzable Set, and All-Screened Analysis Set. Demographic and baseline data for all subjects in the Safety-Analyzable Set were summarized and listed. The effects of treatment at the Overall and all other analysis Time Points were assessed using ANCOVA models. The main effects model contained terms for treatment and Investigator site, with baseline TSSC value as a covariate. The LSMeans and standard errors were based on the main effects model. Methods of analysis of secondary efficacy data included analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) row mean scores tests. Analysis of drug safety included the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE), concomitant medications, vital signs, and physical examination findings for the Safety-Analyzable Set.	0

314	Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic there is urgent need for information about the natural history of the infection in non-hospitalized patients, including the severity and duration of symptoms, and outcome from early in the infection, among different subgroups of patients. In addition, a large, real-world data registry can provide information about how different concomitant medications may differentially affect symptoms among patient subgroups. Such information can be invaluable for clinicians managing chronic diseases during this pandemic, as well as identify interventions undertaken in a naturalistic setting that have differential effects. Such factors may include patient diet, over the counter or prescription medications, and herbal and alternative treatments, among others. Identifying the natural disease history in patients from different demographic and disease subgroups will be important for identifying at-risk patients and effectiveness of interventions undertaken in the community.  Objectives: The purpose of this study is to understand at the population level the symptomatic course of known or suspected COVID-19 patients while sheltering-in-place or under quarantine. Symptoms will be measured using a daily report derived from the CTCAE-PRO as well as free response. Outcomes will be assessed based on the duration and severity of infection, hospitalization, lost-to-follow-up, or death. As a patient-centric registry, patients themselves may propose, suggest, and/or submit evidence or ideas for relevant collection.	0

831	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis continues to be the leading single cause of death in industrialized countries. High serum lipid levels, and especially high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, have been demonstrated to strongly and directly correlate with CVD risks by numerous epidemiological studies. Moreover, large prospective clinical outcome trials have demonstrated that lowering LDL-C decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A meta-analysis of 26 randomized clinical trials comprising 170,000 participants showed that more intensive statin therapy compared to less intensive regimens will reduce coronary deaths or myocardial infarction by an additional 13%.  HIV-infected individuals represent a unique and increasing subset of atherosclerosis. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals now have much improved survival and are faced with health issues related to aging, including cardiovascular disease. Individuals with HIV have higher rates of coronary events compared to controls even in the setting of treated and suppressed disease and a growing body of literature suggests that they are at increased risk for myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and sudden cardiac death. Many facets of atherosclerosis differ in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected individuals with atherosclerosis. HIV-infected patients with acute coronary syndromes are younger and more likely to be males and smokers, with low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), compared to other acute coronary syndrome patients. With respect to pathophysiology, viral replication, antiretroviral drugs all contribute to atherosclerosis.  HIV-associated inflammation induces pro-atherogenic lipid abnormalities and anti-retroviral therapy leads to the development of metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. In a large cross-sectional study, 27% of subjects receiving combination therapy including a protease inhibitor had a total cholesterol level exceeding 240 mg/dl, compared to 8% of untreated HIV subjects, and 40% had triglyceride levels above 200 mg/dl, compared to 15% in untreated subjects. The prevalence and severity of dyslipidemia varies among different antiretroviral drugs; however, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol were associated with HIV infection even before the advent of antiretroviral therapy. Total, HDL-C, and LDL-C decrease at the time of HIV infection, and with antiretroviral treatment total and LDL-C levels increase to pre-infection levels while HDL-C remains low.  Abnormalities in body composition have been reported in 40-50% of HIV-infected patients, with higher rates in those receiving combination antiretroviral therapies. Subcutaneous lipoatrophy commonly affects the face, limbs, and buttocks, and is accompanied by central fat accumulation. Hyperinsulinemia is often also present. In a representative study, diabetes was present in 7% of HIV-infected adults with fat accumulation or lipoatrophy, as compared to 0.5% of control subjects matched for age and BMI. The corresponding rates of glucose intolerance were 35% and 5% respectively. Compared to healthy control subjects, HIV-infected men treated with combination antiretroviral therapy were 4 times as likely to develop diabetes over a 3-year observation period.  The increased cardiovascular risk and dyslipidemia in HIV-infected individuals is difficult to treat for several reasons. Statins reduce LDL-C levels less in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected controls. Fibrates reduce triglyceride levels less in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected controls as well. Drug-drug interactions between statins and protease inhibitors increase the risk of adverse events. Due to these interactions, simvastatin and lovastatin are contraindicated among individuals receiving protease inhibitors and the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 40 mg. Even interactions with rosuvastatin, which is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, have been described.  As a consequence, physicians may avoid treating HIV-infected individuals who would benefit from statins, or use lower doses or less potent statins, reducing the potential for cardiovascular event reduction. High triglyceride levels in HIV-infected subjects are common, and the combination of a fibrate plus antiretroviral therapy increases the risk of drug-drug adverse events, even before consideration of a statin.  Statin treatment reduces lipid levels modestly in HIV subjects. Among 72 HIV-infected subjects in the SATURN-HIV trial randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg/day, LDL-C was reduced by 25.3% by week 24. In another study, of 83 HIV-infected subjects, rosuvastatin 10 mg and pravastatin 40 mg/day reduced LDL-C by 37% and 19% respectively at 45 days. Among 151 HIV-infected subjects randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg/day, LDL-C reductions were greater with rosuvastatin at this dose, but all 3 statins significantly and similarly reduced serum levels of hs-CRP and TNF-a.  Approximately 1/3 of individuals with HIV-infection are co-infected with hepatitis C. Elevated hepatic enzymes due to hepatitis C represent a relative contraindication to statin therapy, and some evidence suggests that a statin might increase hepatitis C activity. Finally, HIV-infected patients often need many medications and have a large daily pill burden. Compliance suffers, but has been shown to improve when single tablet regimens reduce daily pill load. Long-acting injectable antiretroviral drugs are under development as a strategy to reduce pill burden and improve compliance. PCSK9 inhibitor injections would dovetail well with this approach. For these reasons, PCSK9 inhibitor therapy offers advantages over statin therapy in this unique population.  That statins might favorably influence the evolution of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected subjects is suggested by a recent trial where 40 HIV subjects with mild coronary atherosclerosis by CT angiography and aortic inflammation by FDG-PET imaging were randomized to atorvastatin 20-40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for 12 months. Atorvastatin significantly reduced non-calcified coronary plaque volume relative to placebo, as well as the number of high-risk plaques.  In the HIV-uninfected population, statin therapy produced significant and rapid dose-dependent reductions in FDG update that were reflective of changes in atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. In addition, lipoprotein apheresis resulted in significant reduction of arterial inflammation. Recently, addition of evolocumab was found to result in a greater decrease in percent atheroma volume using intravascular ultrasound. All of these studies which were performed in the non-HIV population provide a strong scientific rationale for studying the role of PCSK9 inhibition in HIV. Namely, given the strong association between HIV, noncalcified plaque, and arterial inflammation, PCSK9 therapy may play a unique role in reducing HIV-associated atherosclerosis, Alirocumab (Sar236553/REG 727) is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme responsible for the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and is developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals/Sanofi. In a randomized trial of 2341 patients with heterozygous familiar hypercholesterolemia or with established coronary heart disease or a CHD risk equivalent with LDL levels≥70mg/dL and were receiving treatment with statins at the maximum tolerated dose with or without other lipid-lowering therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to a 2:1 ratio to receive alirocumab 150mg or placebo every 2 weeks for 78 weeks. At week 24 the difference between the alirocumab and placebo groups from baseline to calculated LDL was -62 percentage points. The alirocumab group had higher rates of injection site reactions, myalgia, neurocognitive events and ophthalmologic events. The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was lower in the alirocumab group as compared to placebo in a post hoc analysis (p=0.02).  Preliminary data on 6 HIV-infected individuals inadvertently enrolled in a PCSK9 inhibitor study using evolocumab demonstrated that LDL was lowered 60%, along with significant reductions in triglycerides and Lp(a) and was well tolerated (unpublished data)  Based on these findings a dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks for 6 weeks followed by an upward titration to 150 mg every 2 weeks for those with LDL-C >50 mg/dl for the remainder of the study for this trial will be used. Based on population PK/PD modeling, a dose of 150 mg every 2 weeks in patients on a background of statins is estimated to be equivalent to approximately 80% of the maximal response for LDL-C lowering (-67%). Assuming an average LDL C at baseline of 100 mg/dL for HIV-infected individuals, the mean absolute LDL-C reduction is predicted to be approximately -60 mg/dL.	0

12	"Background  Various kinds of interactive online communication systems have been introduced for long-term diabetes management, and their importance in managing patients is increasing. The investigators investigated the amount of physician time needed to maintain such a system, and the investigators developed software to maximise the cost effectiveness.  Methods  The investigators conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of a semi-automatic response system (SARS) for online glucose monitoring over a 24-week period of patients with type 2 diabetes. In the SARS group, the ""SARS"" software filtered the recorded self-monitoring of blood glucose data automatically to reduce the physicians' time, and the physicians managed patients regularly but only manually in the control (manual) group. The investigators measured the time spent by the physicians for online management and compared the HbA1c levels at enrolment and follow-up."	0

977	COVID-19 has not been well suppressed, and became a pandemic within 3 months globally is mainly because of the virus characteristic in the following aspects:  Long incubation period (average 5-7 days, up to 28 days), and the incubation period is contagious Strong transmissibility, virus can be transmitted through aerosol Difficulty distinguishing infected patients from other pathogenic infections High negative rate of nucleic acid detection in upper respiratory tract samples of infected patients, which increases the difficulty of differential diagnosis of infection with other pathogens The existing RT-PCR nucleic acid detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 has two major problems. First, the procedure is not automated leading to higher requirements for personnel operation level and environment sterilize. What's more the kits are SARS-CoV-2 only. Once the test result is negative, it cannot help diagnose the exact pathogen in one time of experiment.  Therefore, this project intends to independently develop a fully enclosed rapid detection system for a total of 22 pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, on the basis of the QIAstat-Dx fully automatic multiple PCR detection platform. The reasonably designed experiments are used to verify the performance of the cartridge detection and prove its clinical application value. The 22 pathogens tested in this project includes 4 coronavirus subtypes, A / B flu, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc., which is of great significance for the differential diagnosis of similar patients.	0

861	We aim to deduct the seroprevalence of healthcare-personnel (HCP) who had participated in treatment of confirmed patients of Middle-East respiratory syndrome.  In first step, we collected the base-line (pre-exposure) serum from the HCP who worked in the hospitals in which confirmed MERS patients were treated. Pre-exposure serum was collected in a few centers. If the serum was drawn within 3 weeks from initial exposure, then the serum was considered adequate as pre-exposure. (Because, antibody against the MERS-CoV would be produced after more the 17-21 days of exposure). The serum was frozen.  In second step, we will collect the post-exposure serum from the HCP who worked in the hospitals in which confirmed MERS patients were treated or detected. We plan to include 25-30 centers. The timing of sample collection is 6-8 weeks after last contact with confirmed MERS patients. The serum will also freeze.  In third step, we will assay the presence of antibody in collected sample. We will use MERS-CoV ELISA kit (EUROIMMUNE co.) as screening test and MERS-CoV IFA kit (EUROIMMUNE co.) as confirm test.	0

To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus.  The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2.  This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment.  Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours.	0

Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.	0
799	"COVID-19 Viral Global Pandemic resulting in post-infection pulmonary damage, including Fibrotic Lung Disease due to inflammatory and reactive protein secretions damaging pulmonary alveolar structure and functionality. A short review includes:  Early December, 2019 - A pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China, and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office. January 30th, 2020 - The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. February 7th, 2020 - 34-year-old Ophthalmologist who first identified a SARS-like coronavirus) dies from the same virus. February 11th, 2020 - WHO announces a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19. February 19th, 2020 - The U.S. has its first outbreak in a Seattle nursing home which were complicated with loss of lives.. March 11th, 2020 - WHO declares the virus a pandemic and in less than three months, from the time when this virus was first detected, the virus has spread across the entire planet with cases identified in every country including Greenland. March 11th, 2020 - As of this date, Over 60% of all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. can be traced to that single nursing home in Seattle. March 11th, 2020 - Dr. Fauci from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) states, ""If you count all the estimated cases of people who may have it but haven't been diagnosed yet, the mortality rate is probably closer to 1%,"" he said, ""which means it's 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu."" March 21st, 2020 - The U.S. has 24,105 active cases, 301 deaths, and 171 patients declared recovered, a number which has since massively increased within the United States and Globally. March 21st, 2020 - Emerging Infectious Disease estimates the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and ≈1% in other, more mildly affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control."" March 21st 2020 -Much of the United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing abilities ramp up..  March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New York-New Jersey, Washington, and California  Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started.  The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage and inflammatory changes that accompanied.  This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged tissues.  Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders, showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study, driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and scarring reaction.  The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature and in scientific studies.  Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as ""Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency at those intervals.  Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the trials."	0

78	SARS-CoV has caused severe epidemic respiratory disease in human populations. By July 2003, a total of 8,096 probable cases of SARS had been reported including 774 deaths in 27 countries, around one-third of which were health care workers (HCWs). Previous studies have been reported about long-term impacts of SARS infection, including lung function deficiency, steroid-induced osteonecrosis, reduced exercise capacity, and impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HCWs, especially nurses, have been reported to experience greater psychological distress, particularly increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS). But the very complex impacts of this fatal infection on HCWs have not been fully elucidated. It is thus important to follow these occupational patients to detect and manage multi-organ sequelae and functional impairment.	0

859	Tendon disorders compromise pain free activity and often progress to chronic pain with a major impact on quality of life. More than 85,000 patients each year see their general practitioner (GP) with Achilles Tendinopathy (AT) which affects the lower leg in young and middle aged adults. The main treatment is physiotherapy, although surgery is eventually considered in 25-45%of patients, an intervention that requires several months of immobilisation and has unpredictable outcomes.  Other treatments include, shockwave therapy, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (a blood injection of platelet rich plasma) and steroid injections, but other than physiotherapy non have been shown to be better than placebo. There is a need for improved nonsurgical treatments. There is an established treatment in horses that involves injection of the horses own stem cells into the tendon, which has been shown to be effective but has never been used in man. We wish to translate the technology to humans and propose a pilot phase II trial to establish the safety of stem cells implanted in diseased human tendon. We aim to study 10 patients with chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy to assess safety as our primary outcome measure. In addition we capture clinical outcomes scores and ultrasound appearances. Other than the stem cell injection, all assessments will be non invasive. Participants will be otherwise healthy adults, aged 18-70 and recruited from routine outpatient clinics at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, presenting with a painful heel, diagnosed by a specialist as Achilles tendinopathy, and having already undergone a minimum of 6 months of physiotherapy. Each participant will have 6 months follow up. This study will help inform a larger clinical trial in the future for which a further ethics application will be made.	0

992	"The (SARS CoV-2) virus is spreading globally, threatening all healthcare systems. Many healthcare systems and organizations are using different protocols and measures to fight the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and other antiviral medications are currently under research investigations. Natural honey has been well known for its high health properties in diabetes, nutrition, dyslipidemia, skin lesions and it got FDA approval for topical wound treatment in 2007 as the most potent antimicrobial agent. Honey has been previously considered as an alternative for acyclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and it also demonstrated for its significant antiviral effect against varicella zoster virus (VZV). Many studies have demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial effect of honey as an antibacterial, anti fungal, antiviral and antimycobacterial. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommended honey as a first line of treatment for acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract infection which is currently a cornerstone symptom in COVID-19 infectious disease. Moreover, natural honey should no longer be used as ""alternative"" and deserves to gain more attention by scientists and researchers. The aim of this trial is to study the efficacy of natural honey in treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 in comparison with current standard care.  Methods:  This will be a randomized , multi center, double armed clinical trial, patients will be randomly assigned to two groups on 1:1 basis. Natural honey group will include patients receiving standard care and added intervention in the form of natural honey in a dose of 1gm/kg/day (previously used safely in small studies) divided into 2 to 3 doses for continuous 14 days. The other arm is the arm receiving the standard care according to the center protocol.  Our primary outcome is days for recovery using the parameters: turning from positive to negative swaps, days from fever to no fever and lung inflammation recovery in x ray or CT, our secondary outcome is the 30 days mortality rate. Data will be collected and statistically managed using STATA blindly from who received the intervention."	0

202	SARS-CoV-2, one of a family of human coronaviruses, was initially identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city. This new coronavirus causes a disease presentation which has now been named COVID-19. The virus has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11th March 2020. As of 18 March 2020, there are 198,193 number of confirmed cases with an estimated case-fatality of 3%. There is no approved therapy for COVID-19 and the current standard of care is supportive treatment.  SARS-CoV-2 exploits the cell entry receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2) to access and infect human cells. The interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein is not in the active site. This process requires the serine protease TMPRSS2. Camostat Mesilate is a potent serine protease inhibitor. Utilizing research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the closely related SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanism, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked by camostat mesilate. In mice, camostat mesilate dosed at concentrations similar to the clinically achievable concentration in humans reduced mortality following SARS-CoV infection from 100% to 30-35%.	0

310	The novel identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 causes an nationwide outbreak as well as public health crisis in China, and expands globally. Pulmonary edema is one of the most detrimental symptoms and usually presents in severe and critical coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in dyspnea, acute lung injury (ALI) ,acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Recent evidence revealed higher levels of blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. VEGF is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Numerous studies have revealed that VEGF was a key factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALI and ARDS. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF drug, approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, is a promising drug for ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 through suppression of pulmonary edema.	0
961	Glycaemic index (GI) is the measurement of post-meal blood glucose rise cause by ingestion of carbohydrate. For the same amount of carbohydrate, food with lower GI value cause a lower post- meal rise in blood glucose concentration in both normal and diabetic patients. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial has showed that low GI diet can achieve an additional reduction of A1c by 0.4% when compare with usual diabetic diet. Furthermore, various diabetes associations have already endorsed the use of low GI diet in the management of diabetes.  Hong Kong Chinese obtain most of their carbohydrate intake through consumption of rice or rice related foods, which are considered as having high GI value. In addition, it has been demonstrated that Asian have higher post-prandial rise in blood glucose than Caucasian after consuming the same amount of carbohydrate. When the above two factors add together, we expect our local type 2 diabetic patients are suffering from significant post-prandial hyperglycaemia, which in turn translate into elevated 24-hour hyperglycaemia and A1c.  However, nearly all studies about glycaemic index and diabetes are conducted in Caucasian. It is unclear about the benefit in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes who are currently having diet with high GI value.  We therefore hypothesized that low GI diet may improve blood glucose control in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. To test this hypothesis, we plan to conduct this randomized controlled trial about low GI diet in Chinese diabetic patients.	0

8	In December 2019 a new kind of virus was identified in China as the responsible of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and interstitial pneumonia. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread around the world and in February 2020 became a pandemia in Europe.  No pharmacological treatment is actually licensed for the SARS-CoV2 infection and at the current state of art there is a lack of data about the clinical management of the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19).  The aim of this observational study is to collect the data and the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted in the H. Sacco Respiratory Unit treated according to the Standard Operating Procedures and the Good Clinical Practice.	0
571	The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main informed consent and include a screening period of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1 or 2 cycles (21 or 14 days per cycle, respectively), an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier. For the urothelial cancer cohort in Part 2B, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months until death or the cutoff date for the overall survival analysis (approximately 12 months after last patient first dose), whichever comes first.  Patients who have no disease progression, and continue to benefit from the study drug(s), will be allowed to continue treatment beyond the common study end-date at their assigned dose unless the study is terminated by the Sponsor. The expected enrollment period is approximately 42 months.	0
241	Highly communicable and virulent diseases, the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases, and the prospect of bio-terrorism have become part of the new reality for health care workers. SARS transmission has occurred despite the use of droplet, contact, and airborne precautions. Potential explanations for some of the episodes of “through-precautions” transmission include the possibility of contamination during removal of protective clothing.  The recommended protective systems (PPS) for aerosol generating procedures set out by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) differ.  The failure of a PPS may be associated with significant consequences in terms of the morbidity and mortality of front-line health care workers. The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists between the rate of self-contamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions for individuals wearing either the CDC or MOHLTC recommended PPS.  Study participants will don one of the two recommended PPS, be “contaminated” with an indicator that becomes visible under ultraviolet light, and then assessed for contamination of clothing layers and skin after removal of the PPS. They will then repeat the procedure using the other PPS.	0

62	The purpose of this study is to collect plasma by apheresis from patients who have recovered from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This plasma will be processed into a SARS-antibody enriched intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) product. This product will then be available for use in a clinical trial if a SARS epidemic recurs.  Potentially eligible participants are people between 18 and 56 years of age who have recovered from SARS. Potential participants will undergo three sequential screenings to determine their eligibility for this study. Eligible participants will then be scheduled for plasmapheresis. After apheresis, additional testing will be performed on a sample of the source plasma. Once the sample has been tested and cleared, the source plasma will be shipped to the United States to the storage facility and finally to the site of manufacturing of the IVIG product. Participants may donate plasma again after 14 days.  The study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, participation may help develop a treatment that could be useful to other people who become infected with SARS.	0
608	The duration of the study period per subject is 5-7 weeks broken down as follows:  Screening: 1 to 14 days, Treatment: 1 day (2 overnight stays at the study site), Follow-up: up to 5 weeks after dosing (an additional outpatient follow-up may be scheduled depending on the last results).	0
663	The duration of study participation depended on the status of the patient at screening:  For participants receiving atorvastatin 10 mg at stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, the study participation was to be approximately 17 weeks including a screening period of 1 week, a double-blind treatment period of 8 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks. For participants receiving a lipid lowering treatment other than atorvastatin/ or not at stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, or drug naive participants, the study participation was to be approximately 23 weeks with a screening period of 1 week, a run-in treatment period with atorvastatin 10 mg of 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 8 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.	0
315	New coronavirus infection is an important cause of public health emergencies at home and abroad, which seriously affects people's health and social stability. The outbreak of SRAR-COV in China in 2003 caused serious social impact. From January 2002 to August 7, 2003, there were a total of 8,422 cases worldwide, involving 32 countries and regions, of which 919 cases were fatal, with a fatality rate of nearly 11%. The fatality rate of elderly patients and patients with underlying diseases was even more high.There is no precise and effective treatment for coronavirus infection. In vitro, IFN-α2β has inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and closely related coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -CoV. A study showed the effects of interferon-α2β and ribavirin on the replication of nCoV isolates hCoV-EMC / 2012 in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. The combined application may be useful for the management of patients with nCoV infection in the future. At present, the combination therapy of interferon α2β and ribavirin has been successfully applied in the initial treatment and prevention of SARS and MERS.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon α1β in treating patients with new coronavirus infection in Wuhan.	0

643	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is standard-of-care. Therapy to outpatients is generally not given.  No effective therapy currently exists for treatment. The lack of effective therapy diminishes persons presenting post-exposure for self-quarantine. Having an effective post-exposure prophylaxis, even if only partially effective, may additionally create synergy for the public health strategy of case identification and isolation - if a safe prophylaxis is available. People who develop COVID-19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, after an average of 5-6 days after exposure (i.e. mean incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days.  Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory-confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.  Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID19 disease or early preemptive therapy may ameliorate disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy.  The trial is open to enrollment of healthcare workers or household contacts nationwide from across the United States. One must have a known diagnosis or exposure to a known cases. Both asymptomatic persons with exposure within 4 days as well as symptomatic persons with confirmed COVID19 disease within 4 days of symptom onset can consent to participate.

930	"PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial with adaptive ""sample size re-estimation"" design. Volunteers will be randomized into two groups: (A) generalized health education; (B) personalized health education. Participants will go through phone questioning and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity, (4) dietary habits, (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. In Group A: questioning will be done in sequence followed by a shared minimal intervention aimed towards improvement of these factors but without any personalized recommendation. In Group B: each assessment will be followed by specific and personalized recommendations. Assessment will be done weekly during the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. Considering one interim analysis for efficacy the estimated sample size is 3788 (rounded up to 3800) subject per study arm. The planned duration of the follow up is a minimum of one year."	0
